As part of Singaporeâ€™s efforts to reopen our borders safely, fully vaccinated travellers (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) can now travel to Singapore via the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL). 

In order to enter Singapore via the VTL, a traveller, who is not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident, must apply for a <b>Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP)</b> with effect from <b>1 September 2021, 0001 hours (Singapore time)</b>, for entry into Singapore from <b>8 September 2021, 0001 hours (Singapore time)</b>.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do not need to apply for a VTP to travel to Singapore under the VTL, as they can return to Singapore without the need for entry approval provided they adhere to the VTL requirements. Please click here for more information on the requirements.
