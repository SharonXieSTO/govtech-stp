### Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) Requirements
### (a) Vaccination Requirement
<p id="VacReq"><i>For more information, please click <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---post-vaccination-matters">here</a>.</i></p>

#### 1. All travellers under the VTL need to be fully vaccinated. What does ‘fully vaccinated’ mean?

To be considered fully vaccinated, travellers must have received and completed the full regimen of <a href="https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines">WHO EUL vaccines</a> (Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Sinopharm or Sinovac) in either Singapore or their country/region of departure, at least 14 days before their intended date of entry into Singapore. The following regimens are currently recognised:

‒	1 dose of Janssen vaccine; or

</ol>

may still travel to Singapore on a non-designated flight. They will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore.

#### 4. I am fully vaccinated, but my child is not. Can my child and I travel together to Singapore under the VTL?
No, all travellers under the VTL need to be fully vaccinated.
Unvaccinated short-term visitors will not be allowed to travel under the VTL. 

However, unvaccinated:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:18px; list-style-type:lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:18px;"><a href="/sc-pr/overview">Singapore Citizens</a></li><a href="/sc-pr/overview">
</a><li style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:18px;"><a href="/sc-pr/overview"></a><a href="/sc-pr/overview">Permanent Residents</a>, and</li>
<li style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:18px;">Long-Term Pass holders who have received entry approval via the <a href="/wphl/overview">Work Pass Holder General Lane</a>, <a href="/stpl/requirements-and-process">Student’s Pass Holder Lane</a>, or <a href="/scpr-familial-ties-lane/requirements-and-process">SC/PR Familial Ties Lane</a></li>
</ol>

may still travel to Singapore on a non-designated flight. They will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore.

•	Number of QR codes uploaded does not meet the criteria

•	The QR code has been tampered with


<div id="PDT"></div>

 
### (b) Pre-Departure Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test

#### 1. Are travellers under the VTL required to take any pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests?

All travellers must undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours before the scheduled departure time of their designated VTL flight to Singapore and be tested negative for COVID-19.

For example, if the scheduled departure date and time of the visitor’s designated VTL flight is 15 September 2021, 1030hrs, the test must be taken no earlier than 13 September 2021, 1030hrs.

The pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test must be taken at an internationally accredited or recognised laboratory, clinic, or medical facility. The test result certificate must be in English and state the following:

•	the traveller’s name, and at least one other personal identifier such as the date of birth or passport number corresponding corresponding exactly with the information in the traveller’s passport used for entry into Singapore;
•	a negative COVID-19 PCR test result;
•	the date and time when the COVID-19 PCR test was taken; and
•	the name of the testing institution conducting the COVID-19 PCR test.

Travellers are responsible for making their own appointments with the testing institutions to take their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. They must also bear the cost of their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. Please check with the listed testing institutions for the cost of the test.

Travellers, who are unable to produce a valid pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result certificate during check-in at the departure airport, will be refused boarding by the airline.

#### 2. Why must travellers take non-stop designated VTL flights without transit to Singapore?

This is to facilitate traveller processing upon arrival at the airport.

#### 3. Are travellers guaranteed a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore if they have a VTP?

Having a VTP does not guarantee travellers a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore. Travellers are responsible for obtaining their own tickets. Similarly, having a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore does not guarantee a VTP.

#### 4. I have a VTP and I meet the all the requirements under the VTL. However, I did not manage to get a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore?

As required under the VTL Conditions, a VTP holder must travel to Singapore on a designated VTL flight. Short-term visitors and long-term pass holders who did not arrive on a designated VTL flight to Singapore may be denied entry into Singapore.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may return home to Singapore regardless, but will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore.

#### 5. What are the requirements for travellers to be eligible for a designated VTL flight?
To be eligible to take a designated VTL flight, they are required to:

•	be fully vaccinated, i.e. have received and completed the full regimen of the WHO EUL vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Sinopharm or Sinovac) in either Singapore or their country/region of departure, at least 14 days before their intended date of entry into Singapore. The following regimens are currently recognised:
	1 dose of Janssen vaccine; or
	2 same dose of the other WHO EUL vaccines; or
	Any other combination of doses of WHO EUL vaccines that is bilaterally agreed on between Singapore and their country/region of departure.

•	remain in their country/region of departure, or in their country/region of departure and Singapore in the last 21 consecutive days before departing for Singapore; and

•	undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated VTL flight to Singapore, at an internationally accredited or recognised laboratory, clinic, or medical facility, and obtain a test result certificate in English stating the following:

	a negative COVID-19 PCR test result;
	the date and time when the COVID-19 PCR test was taken; and
	the name of the testing institution conducting the COVID-19 PCR test.

Travellers are responsible for making their own appointments with the testing institutions to take their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. They must also bear the cost of their test. Please check with the listed testing institutions for the cost of the test.

#### 6. What flights may Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents take in order to enter Singapore?

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may take either:
(A)	a designated VTL flight; or
(B)	a non-designated flight.

(A) Designated VTL Flights
Those travelling to Singapore on a designated VTL flight will be allowed to go about their activities upon entry into Singapore, without having to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Instead, they will undergo COVID-19 PCR tests on Day 3 and Day 7 of their arrival in Singapore. They must meet the requirements to be eligible for a designated VTL flight.

(B) Non-Designated Flights
Those travelling to Singapore on a non-designated flight will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore.

Long-Term Pass holders holding a VTP may only travel to Singapore on a designated VTL flight. Otherwise, they may be denied entry into Singapore.

Long-Term Pass holders holding a Approval Letter of Entry (ALE) via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Student’s Pass Holder Lane, or SC/PR Familial Ties Lane may only travel to Singapore on a non-designated flight and will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore.

#### 8. What flights may short-term visitors take in order to enter Singapore?

Short-term visitors who are VTP holders may only travel to Singapore on designated VTL flights. Otherwise, they will be denied entry into Singapore.

In addition, short-term visitors must present:
•	a valid visa (for visa-required visitors); and
•	a mobile device with the TraceTogether app already downloaded and with their profiles registered on the app.

A traveller who does not have any of the above may be refused boarding by the airline.

Those unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability or special needs are eligible to be issued TraceTogether tokens with payment of a refundable S$50 deposit (in lieu of the requirement to have a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded) at the Changi Recommends booth at Changi Airport upon arrival in Singapore.

For visitors who do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app or are unable to receive an SMS One-Time Password to register their profile on the TraceTogether app, please refer to Questions 5 and 6 under Contact Tracing – TraceTogether.

#### 10. What should travellers do if they have already booked themselves onto a non-designated flight?

They should approach their airline for assistance.

#### 11. Do travellers need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore?

Travellers under the VTL do not need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore. However, they are advised to check with the relevant authorities on the entry requirements of the country/region to which they are travelling after Singapore.

#### 12. Are travellers required to take designated VTL flights to depart from Singapore?
No, the VTL is meant for travellers who intend to seek entry into Singapore. For travellers flying departing from Singapore, it will depend on the inbound requirements of the destination country/region. Currently, there are no requirements for designated VTL flights.

<div id="OAT"></div>
 
### (d) On-Arrival COVID-19 PCR Test at the Airport

#### 1. How do I pay for the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?
Travellers should register and make payment for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test here.
(This is separate from the pre-payment made at the point of VTP application, which is for the post-arrival Day 3 and Day 7 COVID-19 PCR tests.)

#### 2. Are travellers required to take an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Upon arrival in Singapore, travellers must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at the airport. The test results will likely be out within 24 hours.
After taking the COVID-19 PCR test, travellers are to immediately take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their declared place of accommodation. They must remain isolated at the place of accommodation until their test result is confirmed to be negative. After being notified of their negative test results, travellers will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.

To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, travellers should pre-book and make payment here.

#### 3. What types of transportation do travellers need to use when going from the airport to their declared place of accommodation, after taking the COVID-19 PCR test?

After taking the COVID-19 PCR test, travellers are to immediately take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their declared place of accommodation. The traveller may proceed to the taxi stand or call any of the service providers below to book a taxi.

#### 4. Can travellers shop and dine at Changi Airport and visit Jewel Changi Airport upon arrival in Singapore?

No, travellers are not allowed to shop and dine at Changi Airport, including Jewel Changi Airport. This is because travellers are required to leave the airport immediately after their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, to isolate in their declared accommodation until the test result is confirmed to be negative. 

The only exception is for the purchase of Singapore dollars or SIM cards, or mobile phone rental, which should be done in the airport transit area, before arrival immigration.
Travellers will only be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore after being notified of their negative test results.

#### 5. What types of accommodation do travellers need to use while waiting for their test results?

The self-isolation accommodation types are:
-	residential accommodation (i.e. HDB flat, condominium or landed property); or
-	non-residential accommodation (i.e. hotel or serviced apartment).

Travellers must isolate alone, or with household members who are vaccinated and have the same travel history, arrival date and self-isolation requirement. If there are other occupants in the accommodation, without the same travel history, arrival date and self-isolation requirement, the traveller(s) must isolate in an individual room with an en-suite toilet.

Travellers are required to bear the cost of their accommodation (if applicable) in Singapore.

Travellers may refer to the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) website for a list of hotels. The list is non-exhaustive and travellers may book other available accommodations as long as they offer individual rooms with an en-suite toilet.

#### 6. Can travellers share the same room with family members / travel companions / a caregiver (due to a certified disability or special needs) while waiting for their PCR test results?

If the family member(s), travel companion(s) or caregiver is/are fully vaccinated and share similar travel history in the past 21 days prior to departure for Singapore, travellers may share the same room with such persons, while waiting for their PCR test results.
Please also note that if a traveller’s test result is confirmed to be positive, all persons who had shared the same room with the traveller, as well as those identified to be a close contact, will be issued a Quarantine / Isolation Order, and/or be subject to further public health requirements.

#### 7. How much is the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the airport?

The cost of the COVID-19 PCR test is S$160 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax). Travellers will bear the cost of the test in Singapore.

To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, travellers should pre-book and make payment here.

#### 8. What happens if travellers refuse to undergo the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?
Among other measures which may be taken, if travellers refuse to undergo the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, they may have their VTP cancelled and be refused entry into Singapore. In such an event, travellers may also be liable for all costs incurred for their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation.

#### 9. Can my company / family member / friend pick me up from the airport in a private vehicle and transport me to my declared place of accommodation where I will be waiting for my COVID-19 PCR test results?

Travellers entering Singapore on an approved VTP may be picked up from the airport by their company / family member / friend in a private vehicle. There should not be more than one person picking the traveller up from the airport. 

Travellers must be transported directly to their declared place of accommodation to await their COVID-19 PCR test results. All persons in the private vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. The following precautionary measures are also strongly encouraged:

•	The traveller should sit alone in the back seat and the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied.
•	If more than one traveller is picked up, travellers sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and head to the same declared accommodation.
•	The vehicle windows should be wound down and the air-conditioning turned off, where practical.
•	After the traveller has been dropped off at his/her declared accommodation, the driver should wipe down the vehicle. Please refer to the National Environment Agency (NEA) guidelines for surface cleaning and disinfection.
 
<div id="arrival"></div>

### (e) Post-Arrival Day 3 and Day 7 COVID-19 PCR Tests at Designated Chain of Clinics

#### 1. On which days do travellers need to go for a post-arrival PCR test?
Travellers must undergo COVID-19 PCR tests on Day 3 and Day 7 of their arrival in Singapore. Day 1 refers to the day that the traveller clears arrival immigration in Singapore. To illustrate, if the traveller clears arrival immigration at 2330 hours (Singapore time) on 1 October 2021 (i.e. Day 1), he/she is required to undergo COVID-19 PCR tests on 3 October 2021 (i.e. Day 3) and 7 October 2021 (i.e. Day 7). If the traveller clears arrival immigration at 0030 hours (Singapore time) on 2 October 2021 (i.e. Day 1), he/she is required to undergo COVID-19 PCR tests on 4 October 2021 (i.e. Day 3) and 8 October 2021 (i.e. Day 7).

#### 2. Why do travellers need to take Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

Travellers are subject to Day 3 and Day 7 COVID-19 PCR tests to ensure public health and safety.

#### 3. What are the clinics travellers can go to for their Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

They can visit any of the designated clinics. They are required to undergo their COVID-19 PCR test by 1500 hours (Singapore time) on each day.

#### 4. Can a traveller go to a clinic that is not within the list of designated clinics?

No, travellers must only go to the designated clinics.

#### 5. How do travellers book their appointments for their Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

Travellers may make an appointment booking for their Day 3 and Day 7 PCR tests with any of the designated clinics by using their unique link, which will be emailed to them upon their arrival in Singapore. They will only be able to make their own appointment booking using their unique link.

#### 6. Do travellers need to self-isolate after their Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

No, travellers are not required to self-isolate after their Day 3 and Day 7 tests. Self-isolation is only required pending the results of the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the airport.

#### 7. How soon will the results of the Day 3 and Day 7 tests be out?

Travellers can expect to receive their results within 24 hours of their test.

#### 8. What should travellers do if they test positive for COVID-19?

If tested positive for COVID-19 (i.e. informed of a positive test result), travellers must immediately isolate themselves in their declared accommodation. They should ensure that they are contactable via their declared mobile number and email address and await further instructions by the relevant Singapore authorities. 

#### 9. Can a traveller visit different designated clinics for their Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

Yes, travellers do not need to visit the same designated clinic for both tests. They may make an appointment booking at any designated clinic of their choice, subject to availability of slots.

#### 10. Are travellers allowed to reschedule their Day 3 and Day 7 tests to other days?

No, travellers are required to undergo COVID-19 PCR tests at a designated clinic by 1500 hours (Singapore time) on Day 3 and Day 7 of their arrival in Singapore. Failure to do so may constitute an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA).

A traveller who fails to undergo the required COVID-19 PCR tests may also be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) / Stay Order at an SHN Dedicated Facility.

#### 11. What if travellers intend to leave Singapore prior to Day 3 or Day 7?

If the travellers’ time of departure from Singapore is:
	before 1500 hours on the day of test, they are exempted from taking their scheduled PCR test. Any unutilised charge(s), excluding administrative fees, will be refunded by the designated chain of clinics to the credit card used to pay for the tests.

	at or after 1500 hours on the day of test, they are still required to take their scheduled PCR test. They do not need to wait for the test results to be released before departing Singapore.

The travellers’ time of departure from Singapore is defined as the scheduled time of departure of their flight or ferry, or the time they clear departure immigration if they depart by land.

#### 12. What are the penalties if travellers miss their scheduled Day 3 or Day 7 test?

Failure to undergo the required COVID-19 PCR tests may constitute an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act, and may render the traveller liable upon conviction, in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding S$10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both. For subsequent offence(s), the traveller may be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding S$20,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
 
A traveller who fails to undergo the required COVID-19 PCR tests may also be required, for public health reasons, to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) / Stay Order at an SHN Dedicated Facility pursuant to the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 – Stay Orders) Regulations 2020, and to pay for all charges related to his/her stay, as well as any additional COVID-19 tests required as part of the SHN regime.

Further, the traveller’s VTP may be cancelled, and in such an event, he/she may be liable for the cost of their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future VTP applications may also be rejected.

<div id="AdditionalReq"></div> 

### (h) Additional Requirements for Short-Term Visitors

### (i) Visa Application

<div id="visa"></div>

#### 1. Do visitors with a valid VTP need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa to enter Singapore, must separately obtain a visa. They are advised to do so after receiving their VTP approval and before departing for Singapore.
If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.
Visitors may refer to ICA’s website here for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by the Singapore Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Please note that the VTP is not an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?
All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service here at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.


<div id="insurance"></div>


### (ii) Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance Coverage

#### 1. Why is there a need for visitors to purchase COVID-19 travel insurance?

This is to ensure that short-term visitors will be able to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Those who test positive for COVID-19 typically receive care in private hospitals.

### (iii) Contact Tracing – TraceTogether

For the full requirements and conditions governing the use of TraceTogether, please click here.

General FAQs on TraceTogether can be found here.

#### 1. Must every visitor use TraceTogether?

Yes. All visitors to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app prior to their departure for Singapore. Upon arrival, visitors must activate and use the app (see questions 2 and 3 for app activation queries) for the duration of their stay in Singapore.

Those unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability or special needs are eligible to be issued TraceTogether tokens with payment of a refundable S$50 deposit (in lieu of the requirement to have a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded) at the Changi Recommends booth at Changi Airport or Seletar Business Aviation Centre at Seletar Airport upon arrival in Singapore. As each token is uniquely tagged to each individual, visitors are reminded to carry their own tokens with them wherever they go, and not exchange their tokens with others.

#### 2. After downloading the TraceTogether app, how do I activate it?

After downloading the TraceTogether app, you need to follow the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You will need to verify your mobile number with an SMS One-Time Password and register your profile on the app with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you are using to enter Singapore.
 
Please ensure that your TraceTogether App is updated to the latest version. You will see the Holding Screen after you have registered your profile. You must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on the Holding Screen immediately after you have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore. Follow the instructions until you reach the Home Screen.

Please check that your app has been updated to the latest version.

You can activate your app only after clearing Singapore immigration. There might be a short lag time between after your have cleared immigration and before you can activate the app.

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You must also retain your previous mobile device with the TraceTogether app up to 21 days after departure from Singapore. This is because the TraceTogether app data stored in your previous mobile device also needs to be retained for that duration, as set out in the VTL Condition 2(e)(ii).
