<p id="VacReq"><i>For more information, please click <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---post-vaccination-matters">here</a>.</i></p>

<div id="fullyvaccinated"></div>

#### 1. All travellers under the VTL need to be fully vaccinated. What does ‘fully vaccinated’ mean?

Travellers must have been <a href="/health/vtsg">fully vaccinated</a> in their VTL country/region of departure or Singapore. An individual is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after he or she has received the full regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna or <a href="https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines">WHO EUL Vaccines </a>

<b><i>[For travellers entering Singapore with effect from 18 October 2021, 2359hrs] </i></b>

*Travellers must be [fully vaccinated](/health/vtsg) and have a proof of vaccination issued in any [VTL country/region](/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries) or Singapore, regardless of which [VTL country/region](/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries) they depart from. An individual is considered [fully vaccinated](/health/vtsg) 14 days after he or she has received the full regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna or [WHO EUL Vaccines](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines). Children aged 12 and below in the calendar year (i.e. in the year 2021, those who are born in or after 2009) are <b><u>not</u></b> required to present proof of vaccination. However, they must comply with all other VTL <a href="/vtl/conditions">conditions</a> and be accompanied by a <a href="/health/vtsg">fully vaccinated</a> VTL traveller.*


*For acceptable proofs of vaccination issued in Singapore, please refer to [Question 6](#Q6).*

Please refer to the acceptable vaccine regimes [here](/health/vtsg)


#### 3. Are unvaccinated childeren allowed to travel under the VTL?

MOH has assessed that the risk posed to unvaccinated children aged 12 and below is comparable to that of vaccinated adults.

As such, unvaccinated children aged 12 and below aged 12 and below in the calendar year (i.e. in the year 2021, those who are born in or after 2009), will be eligible to enter Singapore on the VTL with effect from 18 October 2021, 2359hrs.

#### 8. What information needs to be reflected on the vaccination certificates?

The electronic or physical vaccination certificate(s) should be in English and clearly state the following:
- the traveller’s name, and at least one other personal identifier such as the date of birth or passport number corresponding exactly with the information in the traveller’s passport used for entry into Singapore;
- the country/region of vaccination, which must be either Singapore or the VTL country/region the traveller is departing from;<br> **[For travellers entering Singapore with effect from 18 October 2021, 2359hrs]** the country/region of issuance must be any [VTL country/region](/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries) or Singapore, regardless of which [VTL country/region](/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries) they depart from;

#### 1. Are travellers under the VTL required to take any pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests?

All travellers, except those aged 2 and below in the calendar year (i.e. in the year 2021, those who are born in or after 2019), must undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours before departure for Singapore.

For example, if the visitor’s scheduled time of departure for Singapore is 15 September 2021, 1030hrs, the test must be taken no earlier than 13 September 2021, 1030hrs.

The pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test must be taken at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing">internationally accredited or recognised laboratory, clinic, or medical facility</a>. The test result certificate must be in English and state the following:

#### 2. Are travellers guaranteed a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore if they have a VTP?

Having a VTP does not guarantee travellers a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore. Travellers are responsible for obtaining their own tickets. Similarly, having a ticket on a designated VTL flight to Singapore does not guarantee a VTP.

As required under the VTL <a href="/vtl/conditions">Conditions</a>, a VTP holder must arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL flight. Short-term visitors and long-term pass holders who did not arrive on a designated VTL flight to Singapore may be denied entry into Singapore.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may return home to Singapore regardless, but will be subject to the <a href="/health/shn">prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements</a> upon entry into Singapore.

#### 4. Can travellers shop and dine at Changi Airport and visit Jewel Changi Airport upon arrival in Singapore?

No, travellers are not allowed to shop and dine at Changi Airport, including Jewel Changi Airport. This is because travellers are required to leave the airport immediately after their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, to isolate in their declared accommodation until the test result is confirmed to be negative. 

The only exception is for the purchase of Singapore dollars or SIM cards, or mobile phone rental, which should be done in the airport transit area, before arrival immigration.

Travellers will only be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore after being notified of their negative test results.

#### 5. What types of accommodation do travellers need to use while waiting for their test results?

The self-isolation accommodation types are:
- residential accommodation (i.e. HDB flat, condominium or landed property); or
- non-residential accommodation (i.e. hotel or serviced apartment).

Travellers must isolate alone, or with household members who are vaccinated and have the same travel history, arrival date and self-isolation requirement. If there are other occupants in the accommodation, without the same travel history, arrival date and self-isolation requirement, the traveller(s) must isolate in an individual room with an en-suite toilet.

Travellers are required to bear the cost of their accommodation (if applicable) in Singapore.

Travellers may refer to the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) <a href="https://www.sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation">website</a> for a list of hotels. The list is non-exhaustive and travellers may book other available accommodations as long as they offer individual rooms with an en-suite toilet.

#### 6. Can travellers share the same room with family members / travel companions / a caregiver (due to a certified disability or special needs) while waiting for their PCR test results?

If the family member(s), travel companion(s) or caregiver is/are <a href="/health/vtsg">fully vaccinated</a> and share similar travel history in the past 14 days prior to departure for Singapore, travellers may share the same room with such persons, while waiting for their PCR test results.

Please also note that if a traveller’s test result is confirmed to be positive, all persons who had shared the same room with the traveller, as well as those identified to be a close contact, will be issued a Quarantine / Isolation Order, and/or be subject to further public health requirements.

#### 7. How much is the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test at the airport?

The cost of the COVID-19 PCR test is S$160 (inclusive of Goods and Services Tax). Travellers will bear the cost of the test in Singapore.

To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, travellers should pre-book and make payment <a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/">here</a>.

#### 8. What happens if travellers refuse to undergo the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Among other measures which may be taken, if travellers refuse to undergo the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, they may have their VTP cancelled and be refused entry into Singapore. In such an event, travellers may also be liable for all costs incurred for their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation.

#### 9. Can my company / family member / friend pick me up from the airport in a private vehicle and transport me to my declared place of accommodation where I will be waiting for my COVID-19 PCR test results?

Travellers entering Singapore on an approved VTP may be picked up from the airport by their company / family member / friend in a private vehicle. There should not be more than one person picking the traveller up from the airport. 

Travellers must be transported directly to their declared place of accommodation to await their COVID-19 PCR test results. All persons in the private vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. The following precautionary measures are also strongly encouraged:

- The traveller should sit alone in the back seat and the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied.
- If more than one traveller is picked up, travellers sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and head to the same declared accommodation.
- The vehicle windows should be wound down and the air-conditioning turned off, where practical.
- After the traveller has been dropped off at his/her declared accommodation, the driver should wipe down the vehicle. Please refer to the National Environment Agency (NEA) <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/cleaning-and-disinfection/advisories/advisory-on-surface-cleaning-and-disinfection-for-covid-19">guidelines</a> for surface cleaning and disinfection.

#### 6. How do travellers book their appointments for their Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

#### 7. Do travellers need to self-isolate after their Day 3 and Day 7 tests?

- <b>at or after 1500 hours on the day of test</b>, they are still <u>required</u> to take their scheduled PCR test. They do not need to wait for the test results to be released before departing Singapore.

### (g) Additional Requirements for Short-Term Visitors

### (i) Visa Application

<div id="visa"></div>

#### 1. Do visitors with a valid VTP need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa to enter Singapore, must separately obtain a visa. They are advised to do so after receiving their VTP approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.

Visitors may refer to ICA’s website <a href="">here</a> for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by the Singapore Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please note that the VTP is <u><b>not</b></u> an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend">here</a> at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.

<div id="insurance"></div>


### (ii) Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance Coverage

#### 1. Why is there a need for visitors to purchase COVID-19 travel insurance?

This is to ensure that short-term visitors will be able to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Those who test positive for COVID-19 typically receive care in private hospitals.

#### 2. What is the minimum coverage for COVID-19 travel insurance?

Visitors must purchase travel insurance for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travelling to Singapore. Should their COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond S$30,000, visitors will have to pay for the excess.

#### 3. How can visitors purchase the required insurance coverage?

Visitors must purchase COVID-19 travel insurance prior to their travel to Singapore. The SafeTravel website provides <a href="">a list of the Singapore-based insurers’ products</a>. Visitors can visit the respective insurers’ websites to purchase the inbound insurance plan. They may reach out to the insurers for more information.

#### 4. Do visitors need to show proof of travel insurance purchase when they apply for the VTP?

Visitors will have to declare, at the point of VTP application, that they will purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travelling to Singapore. They must also carry with them an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to facilitate their entry into Singapore.

#### 5. What penalties will be imposed on the visitor if he/she did not buy the insurance prior to entering Singapore?

Purchase of travel insurance is a condition of the VTL. Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the VTL may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the VTP and/or Visit Pass. In such an event, the VTP holder may be repatriated, and be liable for the cost of his/her repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future VTP applications may also be rejected.

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. 

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

#### 11. Can travel agents apply for VTP on behalf of their clients?

No. Travellers will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the VTL, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

#### 12. Why was I unsuccessful in applying for a VTP?

A VTP application may be unsuccessful for reasons such as:
- Invalid vaccination QR code
- Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
- Passport validity is less than 6 months
 
#### 13. How do I change the validity of my VTP?

A VTP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from your intended date of entry and up to six calendar days after.

If your travel plans change and you need to enter before or after the validity period, please submit a new VTP application. The prepayment for your Day 3 and Day 7 PCR tests under your unutilised VTP will be refunded automatically to your credit card, excluding administrative fees. The expected waiting time for the refund is about three weeks after the end of the validity period of your VTP, depending on the credit card issuing bank.

Should you require assistance to seek urgent entry into Singapore within the next 6 days, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form [here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry) or call the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at 6812 5555. Kindly note that all appeals are assessed on a case-by-case basis. 

#### 14. How do I change my declared particulars (e.g. mobile number, email address, self-isolation accommodation) on my VTP application?

If your particulars have changed, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">here</a> or call the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at 6812 5555.

#### 15. How can I cancel my VTP as I no longer wish to travel to Singapore?

You do not need to cancel your VTP. If you do not utilise your VTP within the validity period, the prepayment for your Day 3 and Day 7 PCR tests will be refunded automatically to your credit card, excluding administrative fees. The expected waiting time for the refund is about three weeks after the end of the validity period of your VTP, depending on the credit card issuing bank.

#### 16. Will the removal of the requirement to undergo Day 3 and Day 7 COVID-19 PCR tests apply to VTL travellers from Brunei Darussalam and Germany as well?

Yes, all VTL travellers, including those from Brunei Darussalam and Germany, who are entering Singapore with effect from 18 October 2021, 2359hrs (Singapore time), will not be required to undergo post-arrival COVID-19 PCR tests.

If you have previously made payment for their Day 3 and Day 7 tests, you will automatically receive a refund from the designated chain of clinics through the credit card used to pay for the tests.

#### 17. Why am I required to pay for two COVID-19 PCR tests if my intended date of entry into Singapore is on or after 19 October 2021?

Travellers submitting a VTP application before 12 October 2021, 0000hrs (Singapore time), will be charged for two COVID-19 PCR tests, regardless of their intended date of entry.

If you have made payment for your Day 3 and Day 7 tests, but enter Singapore with effect from 18 October 2021, 2359hrs (Singapore time), the payment for the Day 3 and Day 7 tests will be automatically refunded by the designated chain of clinics to the credit card used to pay for the test.

Alternatively, if you submit a VTP application from 12 October 2021, 0000hrs (Singapore time) onwards, you will not have to make any payment at the point of application.

#### 18. Can travellers use the VTP to transit/transfer through Singapore?
