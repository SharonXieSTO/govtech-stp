This page contains FAQs for travellers who have understood the entry requirements into Singapore via the Vaccinated Travel Lane (Air/Land/Sea). Singapore time (SGT) is used for all dates and times shown on this page. If you are not clear on the VTL (Air/Land/Sea) requirements, please refer to the VTL (Air) Overview page, VTL (Land) Overview page or VTL (Sea) Overview page before reading this FAQ page.

Travellers intending to travel out of Singapore to a country/region are advised to check the prevailing entry requirements of the destination, and to exercise care and caution, especially when travelling with children. For the general advisory on all departures from Singapore, please visit the "Departing from Singapore" page.

Vaccination Requirements
(a) Eligibility and Proof of Vaccination
1. Are persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated allowed to travel under the VTL?
Persons who are medically unfit to be vaccinated are not allowed to travel under the VTL.

Use the self-checker tool on the Travelling to Singapore page to determine the alternative Travel Lanes that are available.

2. How do I prove my vaccination status when applying for a VTP if:
I am a Long-Term Pass Holder or Short-Term Visitor with Singapore-issued vaccination records; or
I was fully vaccinated in a non-VTL country/region and had my vaccination records ingested into the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH)’s National Immunisation Registry (NIR)?
Please check if your Singapore vaccination records are valid through this link and, if necessary, re-tag your records to your most updated identification (e.g. passport/FIN/IC) number. The retagging process takes around 2 – 4 weeks. Please attempt to resubmit a VTP application only after receiving confirmation from the Ministry of Health/ Health Promotion Board that your records have been successfully retagged. More information on updating your vaccination records can be found on this link.

You may also choose to upload the QR code on your Singapore Vaccination HealthCert issued via the Notαrise portal, if you have one. Please select ‘No’ when prompted if you have a ‘Vaccination Certificate Issued in Singapore or Vaccination Record Ingested into Singapore’s National Immunisation Registry’ on the portal and proceed to upload your QR code.

You do not need to upload your QR code for booster vaccinations.

3. I was fully vaccinated in a non-VTL (Air) country/region and have an accepted proof of vaccination. Do I satisfy the vaccination requirement?
Yes. Please refer to the instructions here for the accepted proof of vaccination.

4. What information does the vaccination certificates need to contain?
The electronic or physical vaccination certificate(s) must be an accepted proof of vaccination, and clearly state the following:

your name, and at least one other personal identifier such as your date of birth or passport number corresponding exactly with the information in your passport used for entry into Singapore;
the name(s) of vaccine(s) used; and
the date(s) of vaccination. The date of the last dose should be administered at least 14 days before your arrival in Singapore.
5. I was diagnosed with COVID-19 and have since recovered. I have been administered only one vaccine dose of a typically two-dose regimen. Do I fulfil the VTL vaccination requirement?
Yes, if the date of your vaccine dose is:

at least 14 days before the date of your intended arrival into Singapore; and
at least 28 days after the date of your first positive COVID-19 test.
You must present a recovery certificate or discharge memo, which shows the date of your first positive COVID-19 test, to prove your recovery from COVID-19, in addition to your vaccination certificate showing 1 dose of vaccine.

If you are required to apply for a VTP, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form here and provide your proof of vaccination and recovery certificate or discharge memo.

You do not need to present a separate recovery certificate or discharge memo if you hold an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC) of vaccination, NHS COVID Pass of vaccination, or Northern Ireland COVID certificate showing the final dose in the series (i.e. “1/1”). If you are required to apply for a VTP, you need only upload the QR code found on your vaccination certificate.

6. Are travellers required to obtain a booster dose to be eligible for the VTL?
Currently, VTL travellers are not required to obtain a booster dose. They are only required to be fully vaccinated with their primary vaccination series to be eligible for entry into Singapore.

Nonetheless, individuals aged 12 years and older are recommended to receive a booster dose from about five months after the last dose of their primary vaccination series, or as soon as possible thereafter, in order to maintain good protection against COVID-19.

(b) Digitally Verifiable Vaccination Certificate and QR Code Issues
1. What is considered an accepted proof of vaccination, how can I check its validity and which can I upload onto the VTP portal?
For Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass Holders (excluding Work Permit Holders)

If you are a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident, or a Long Term Pass Holder (excluding work permit holder), you need not apply for a VTP. You will need to show an accepted proof of vaccination to the VTL transport operator at check-in and at arrival immigration. You are encouraged to upload your vaccination certificate QR code, if you have one, as part of your Singapore Arrival Card / electronic Health Declaration Card submission to facilitate your arrival processing in Singapore. You are also strongly encouraged to self-verify your vaccination certificate using the self-verification tool(s) available for your vaccination certificate, if available, prior to your trip.

For Short-Term Visitors and Work Permit Holders

If you are a Short-Term Visitor (STV) or Work Permit Holder (WPH) in Singapore, you need to apply for a VTP. Depending on your proof of vaccination, you may be required to upload your vaccination certificate QR code on the VTP application portal. You should upload the QR code(s) of your primary series only (i.e. first and second doses); regardless of whether you have obtained a booster dose.

Those who are required to upload a QR code but cannot do so are to write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form here and produce their vaccination certificate, travel documentation (e.g. passport) and other supporting documents. If you encounter an error upon uploading the QR code on your vaccination certificate onto the VTP application portal, despite meeting the requirements above, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form here and provide your vaccination certificate. If you are unable to obtain one of the digitally verifiable vaccination certificates listed above, you will not be eligible for travel on the VTL.

You may check for the acceptable proof of vaccination, how to verify its validity and how to use the certificates during VTP application (if required) based on the certificate’s country/region of issuance below.

(2) Travel History Requirement
1. How is the 7-day travel history determined?
If the traveller’s scheduled day of departure for Singapore is D (e.g. 8 March 2022), the traveller must have only travelled to or transited via one or more of the VTL countries/regions, Category I countries/regions and/or Singapore from D-7 to D (i.e. 1 to 8 March 2022, if D is 8 March 2022).

2. I am travelling from Singapore to a VTL country/region and will be back in less than 7 consecutive days. Will I be eligible to return to Singapore on the VTL?
Yes, you will be eligible for the VTL so long as your travel history within the past 7 consecutive days before departure for Singapore only consists of one or more of the VTL countries/regions, Category I countries/regions and/or Singapore. For example, your 7-day travel history may include 5 days in Singapore, 5 days in the United Kingdom, and 4 days in Germany.

3. I intend to arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL (Air) flight and have an acceptable proof of vaccination, but I have travel history to or will transit via a non-VTL (Air) or non-Category I country/region prior to that flight. Will I be eligible for the VTL?
No, you will not be eligible for the VTL. Return to the Travelling to Singapore page to find alternative SafeTravel Lanes.

3) Application for the Vaccinated Travel Pass
Note: Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and unvaccinated children aged 12 and below in this calendar year (i.e. born in or after 2010) are not required to apply for a VTP (Air)/VTP (Land)/VTP (Sea). However, they must comply with all other VTL (Air) conditions/VTL (Land)/VTL (Sea). Long-Term Pass holders (excluding Work Permit holders) are not required to apply for a VTP.

Note: Long-Term Pass In-Principle Approval holders (excluding Work Permit holders) are not required to apply for a VTP.

Travellers with IPA for Long-Term Passes issued by the Ministry of Education (MOE) or the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) should submit their VTP application under the ‘Short-Term Visitor’ traveller type. They will need to comply with all the VTL (Air) conditions/VTL (Land) conditions/VTL (Sea) conditions that apply to short-term visitors.

Those with IPA for Long-Term Passes or a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) should submit their VTP (Air)/VTP (Land)/VTP (Sea) application under the ‘Singapore Long-Term Pass Holder’ traveller type.

6. I have an In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a Singapore-issued Long-Term Pass (i.e. Work Permit, Employment Pass, Student Pass, or Long-Term Visit Pass). Am I allowed to travel under the VTL (Land)?
IPA holders are not eligible to utilise the VTL (Land) for travel to Singapore, unless they are Malaysia Citizens. However, they may still travel to Singapore with necessary approvals under the Work Pass Holder General Lane and will be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore, including any Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements.

7. I am a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident or holder of a Singapore Long-Term Pass entering Singapore using the VTL (Land). Can my spouse, child or family member who is not a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident or holder of a Singapore Long-Term Pass accompany me to enter Singapore under the VTL (Land)?
Your family member can accompany you to enter Singapore under the VTL (Land), only if he or she is a Malaysia Citizen.

Otherwise, your family member will not be allowed to accompany you. During the initial phase of the VTL (Land), only citizens of both countries, along with permanent residents and long-term pass holders of the country that they are entering are eligible to travel under this arrangement. Given the high demand for cross-border land travel, we are prioritising persons who have been impacted by COVID-19 and separated from their families for many months during the initial phase.

8. If I am a Malaysia Citizen, Malaysia Permanent Resident or holder of a Malaysia Long-Term Pass entering Malaysia using the VTL (Land), can I use the VTL (Land) to re-enter to Singapore?
Malaysia Citizens can enter Singapore under VTL (Land).

Malaysia Permanent Residents or holders of a Malaysia-issued long-term pass are not allowed to enter Singapore under VTL (land) unless they are a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident or holder of a Singapore-issued Long-Term pass.

9. Why did I face errors while applying for a VTP?
A VTP application may be unsuccessful for reasons such as:

Invalid vaccination QR code
Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
Passport validity is less than 6 months
10. How do I change the validity of my VTP?
A VTP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from your intended date of entry and up to 13 calendar days after. If your travel plans change and you need to enter before or after the validity period, please submit a new VTP application.

Should you require assistance to seek urgent entry into Singapore within the next 2 days, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form here or call the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at 6812 5555. Kindly note that all appeals are assessed on a case-by-case basis.

11. How do I change my declared particulars (e.g. mobile number, email address, self-isolation accommodation) on my VTP application?
If your particulars have changed, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form here with your revised particulars.

12. How can I change my passport number on my VTP?
You will not be able to change the passport number on an existing VTP. Please submit a new application with the correct details reflected. Do note that travellers with an inaccurate passport number on their VTP may be denied boarding and entry into Singapore.

If your intended date of entry is no longer available on the VTP application portal, please adjust your travel plans. You will not be allowed to board the designated VTL transport if you are unable to present a valid VTP.

13. How can I cancel my VTP as I no longer wish to travel to Singapore?
You do not need to cancel your VTP. If you do not utilise your VTP within the validity period, it will automatically expire.

(4) Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test
Note: Children aged 2 and below in this calendar year (i.e. born in or after 2020) are not required to undergo a pre-departure COVID-19 test. Recently-recovered travellers may qualify for exemption from the pre-departure COVID-19 test. They must present a valid proof of recovery.

1. If I am entering a VTL country/region for a very short trip, can I use my negative pre-departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test or Antigen Rapid Test (ART) results, taken in Singapore for departure, to fulfil the pre-departure test requirement for my return leg to Singapore?
You will fulfil the pre-departure test requirement only if the PCR test or ART was taken within 2 days before departure for Singapore.

As an example, a traveller takes a pre-departure ART in Singapore on 1 March 2022 and enters Malaysia on the same day. If he intends to return to Singapore under the VTL (Land) / VTL (Sea) between 1 and 3 March 2022, the ART taken on 1 March 2022 will fulfil the pre-departure test requirement for entry into Singapore.

2. If I am entering a VTL country/region for a very short trip, can I use my negative On-Arrival Test (OAT) taken in the VTL country/region to fulfil the pre-departure test requirement for my return leg to Singapore, if the OAT was taken within 2 days of my date of departure to Singapore?
The OAT taken in the VTL country/region is acceptable as long as it fulfils the criteria detailed below for an acceptable pre-departure test for departing to Singapore.

The OAT must be a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR test) at an internationally accredited or recognised lab/clinic/medical facility, or Antigen Rapid Test (ART) administered by a trained professional (self-swabs are disallowed). The PDT result must not be a handwritten document, and fulfil the following:

Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and
Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.

(5) Designated VTL Transport
1. Are travellers guaranteed a ticket on a designated VTL flight/bus/ferry to Singapore if they have a VTP?
Having a VTP does not guarantee travellers a ticket on a designated VTL (Air) flight/ VTL (Land) bus/ VTL (Sea) ferry to Singapore. Travellers are responsible for obtaining their own tickets. Similarly, having a ticket on a designated VTL (Air)/VTL (Land)/VTL (Sea) flight to Singapore does not guarantee a VTP.

2. I have a VTP and I meet all the requirements under the VTL, except that I only managed to book a non-VTL transport service. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore under quarantine-free VTL terms?
