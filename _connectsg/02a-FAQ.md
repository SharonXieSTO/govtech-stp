## General Queries

#### 1. What is the Connect@Singapore initiative?

The Connect@Singapore initiative allows a limited number of business, official and high economic value travellers to enter Singapore to enter Singapore via air travel, for short-term stays of up to 14 days. Travellers from all countries are eligible to apply to the scheme, subject to prevailing national travel policies. For the entire duration of their stay, travellers will be housed in Appointed Facilities, undergo regular testing, and strictly observe all prevailing Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Travellers will be able to conduct meetings with local visitors and with other traveller groups (with SMMs in place) while in the facilities.

#### 2. What is a SafeTravel Pass under the Connect@Singapore initiative? 

The SafeTravel Pass issued under the Connect@Singapore initiative is a non-transferrable single-entry approval document that allows a traveller to make short-term business, official, or high-economic value visits to Singapore within a stipulated week (0000 hours Monday to 2359 hours Sunday), and to remain in Singapore for up to 14 days.

SafeTravel Passes are approved on a limited basis to mitigate the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.

#### 3. Am I eligible to apply for the Connect@Singapore initiative? 

Potential travellers are eligible to apply for the Connect@Singapore initiative for travel to Singapore if they are:
<ul>

#### 4. Are Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, eligible for the Connect@Singapore initiative?

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are eligible for the Connect@Singapore initiative. However, should they wish to return to the community, they will be required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities, regardless of the duration of stay at Connect@Singapore Appointed Facilities. An individual’s time spent in the Appointed Facility is not considered as part of the SHN period, as they may interact with other high-risk travellers during their stay.

#### 5. What is the objective of Connect@Singapore?

Connect@Singapore is an air travel initiative that is part of Singapore’s efforts to re-open our borders in a controlled and safe manner, with necessary public health safeguards in place. The initiative complements other existing travel lanes that have been established such as the Reciprocal Green Lane, and will facilitate essential global business exchanges and support the revival of Singapore’s air hub status and hospitality sector.

#### 6. Is there a quota for the number of travellers that can come into Singapore under the Connect@Singapore initiative? How many travellers are expected to use this lane?

Connect@Singapore is a safe, controlled step towards facilitating Singapore’s gradual reopening as an international business hub. The lane will be open to a limited number of travellers under stringent public health guidelines, to mitigate the risk of imported COVID-19 cases. We will monitor the take-up of the lane closely to ensure that public health considerations are necessarily addressed.

#### 7. Connect@Singapore is for business, official, and high-economic value travellers. How are potential travellers’ applications assessed? Does it mean that only travellers from big firms or MNCs can come into Singapore? What about opportunities for the SMEs? 

The Appointed Facilities will work with the Singapore authorities to assess applications from potential travellers. We welcome all business travellers who may wish to utilise the scheme to conduct high-economic value transactions or activities, such as accessing professional and financial services, as well as official and essential business exchanges.

#### 8. How long can I stay in Singapore under the Connect@Singapore initiative? 
 
The Connect@Singapore initiative allows travellers to seek short-term stays in Singapore of up to 14 days. For the entire duration of their stay, to mitigate the risk of imported COVID-19 cases, travellers will be housed in Appointed Facilities, undergo regular testing, and strictly observe all prevailing Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Travellers will be able to conduct meetings with local visitors and with other traveller groups (with SMMs in place) while in the facilities.

#### 9. Can travellers under the Connect@Singapore initiative extend their stay in Singapore?

Travellers who are <u>not</u> Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents are not allowed to extend their stay in Singapore beyond the 14-day maximum stay under the Connect@Singapore initiative. 

<div id="Process"></div>

## Application Process

#### 10. How do I apply for a SafeTravel Pass under the Connect@Singapore initiative for travel to Singapore?

Travellers must submit applications through an Appointed Facility (the latest list of Appointed Facilities can be found <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/connect-singapore-pilot.html">here</a>). The Appointed Facility (AF) will then apply for a SafeTravel Pass for the traveller on their behalf. A SafeTravel Pass approval letter will be issued to the AF and travellers upon approval of the application. 

#### 11. What are the Appointed Facilities approved under the Connect@Singapore initiative?

Appointed Facilities are responsible for applying for a SafeTravel Pass for Connect@Singapore travellers. Connect@Singapore travellers will also be housed in Appointed Facilities (AFs) during the entire duration of their stay. The list of AFs can be found <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/connect-singapore-pilot.html">here</a>.

#### 12. Do I need a visa for travel to Singapore under the Connect@Singapore initiative?

The SafeTravel Pass application does not supplant the requirement to apply for a visa for entry to and stay in Singapore. Eligible travellers who require a visa for travel to Singapore must separately obtain a valid visa before departing for Singapore. Individuals can check if they require a visa to enter Singapore <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements">here</a>.

#### 13. What is the application window for the SafeTravel Pass application under the Connect@Singapore initiative? 

The application for the SafeTravel Pass is open for a period of two to five weeks before the stipulated week (0000 hours Monday to 2359 hours Sunday) of the traveller’s planned departure to Singapore.

Applicants should take into consideration the time involved for application and visa processing (if required), as well as the mandatory pre-departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore. 

#### 14. How will I be notified on the outcome of my SafeTravel Pass application under the Connect@Singapore initiative?

The applicant will be notified of the outcome of the SafeTravel Pass application via the email provided in the application. 

#### 15. Some information in my SafeTravel Pass application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application or approved SafeTravel Pass? 

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and approved SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details in the application are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 16. Can I travel with a group under the Connect@Singapore initiative? 

Connect@Singapore travellers may conduct business in a ‘travel cohort’ of up to five individuals with similar travel history and <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf">entry requirements into Singapore</a>. The travel cohort must be declared to the Safe Travel Office at the point of application. The travel cohort may comprise members outside of your family, such as colleagues, business partners, suppliers or customers, even if arriving from different flights and/or countries. The group composition of the travel cohort must be kept constant throughout the entire duration of stay. 

#### 17. I recently tested positive for COVID-19 but am scheduled to travel to Singapore. Can I still visit Singapore?

You should schedule your travel into Singapore at least 21 days after your date of COVID-19 diagnosis, based on your first positive PCR test. For example, if the date of your swab which yielded your first positive PCR test is on 1 Jan (Day 1), you should only depart for Singapore on 22 Jan (Day 22) and onwards. You should not travel if feeling unwell.

Travellers with a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days will be denied boarding on flights bound for Singapore. 

<div id="HealthMeasures"></div>

## Health Measures in Singapore

#### 18. What pre-departure requirements must I comply with prior to entry to Singapore?

The complete list of pre-departure requirements prior to Connect@Singapore travellers’ entry into Singapore can be found <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/connectsg/requirements-and-process">here</a>.

#### 19. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Travellers must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, and are required to remain isolated in their room in the Appointed Facility (AF) until the test yields a negative result. Subject to further assessment, travellers with a history of infection from COVID-19 may be required to undergo serology tests on arrival to Singapore to confirm their recovered status. Travellers must also take PCR tests on days 3, 7, and 14 of their stay in Singapore insofar as the traveller remains accommodated in the AF. Travellers are required to adhere to all prevailing national Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in the AF, including the use of TraceTogether and SafeEntry.

Travellers may also be required to undergo additional testing requirements as subjected by their AF. Travellers should refer to the relevant  details in the SafeTravel Pass approval letter, which will be issued with the SafeTravel Pass approval letter, for full details on the health measures that they must observe upon arrival in Singapore.

#### 20. Can I arrange for my own transportation or use public transportation for my journey between the airport and the Appointed Facility?

No, travellers will be transported between the airport and the Appointed Facility (AF) by a dedicated transport provider arranged by the AF. 

#### 21. Can I leave my room while waiting for the results of my on-arrival PCR test?

No, travellers are required to remain isolated in their room in the Appointed Facility (AF) until their on-arrival PCR test yields a negative result. After receiving a negative on-arrival PCR test result, travellers may proceed with their itinerary within the AF.

#### 22. What happens if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore?

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore will be given medical treatment accordingly. The cost of the relevant medical treatments will be borne in full by the travellers.

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Visit Pass holders may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance, where applicable. 

#### 23. Since the Connect@Singapore scheme is open to travellers from most countries, including those from countries of higher risk profiles, how will the safety of the local community be ensured?

To limit the risk of spread to the local community, travellers will not be allowed to leave the AF. As an added precaution, AF staff serving travellers will have to undergo Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) so that any COVID-positive individuals can be identified quickly, and close contacts quickly ring-fenced. 

Travellers will undergo an enhanced testing regime involving: 
- A pre-departure PCR test no more than 72 hours before departure to Singapore;
- An on-arrival PCR test upon arrival in Singapore; and 
- PCR tests on days 3, 7, and 14 of their stay, insofar as the traveller remains accommodated in the Appointed Facility (AF). 

#### 24. What is the rationale behind the testing regime for Connect@Singapore travellers? Should travellers be tested more/less frequently?

This frequent retesting regime is a risk-based approach to manage the risk of transmission within the AF. By testing travellers more frequently, infections can be detected in a timely manner. 

#### 25. Can travellers take other COVID-19 tests, such as Antigen Rapid Testing (ART), instead of PCR tests?

No, travellers must take the tests as stipulated under the T&Cs of the Safe Travel Pass, i.e. PCR tests.  

#### 26. Will I be required to have COVID-19 travel insurance coverage when travelling under the Connect@Singapore scheme?

Short-term visitors entering Singapore are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. While COVID-19 travel insurance coverage is currently not mandatory for travellers under the Connect@Singapore initiative, travellers are strongly encouraged to purchase their own travel insurance for COVID-19 related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore.

## Activities in the Appointed Facilities

#### 27. What are Connect@Singapore travellers allowed to do while in Singapore?

The Connect@Singapore initiative is for business, official and high-economic value travellers and their associated persons. For instance, travellers will be able to conduct meetings with local visitors and other traveller groups within the Appointed Facility (AF). Travellers will not mingle with the local community, and will be required to stay within the AF with robust Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.

#### 28. Can I mingle with other travellers under the Connect@Singapore initiative? 

Connect@Singapore travellers may conduct business in a ‘travel cohort’ of up to five individuals with similar travel history and <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf">entry requirements into Singapore</a> into Singapore. The travel cohort must be pre-approved by the Safe Travel Office, and pre-declared to the Appointed Facility (AF). The travel cohort may comprise members outside of your family, such as colleagues, business partners, suppliers or customers, even if arriving from different flights and/or countries. The group composition of the travel cohort must be kept constant throughout the entire duration of stay. 
<br><br>
All prevailing national Safe Management Measures (SMMs) will apply to travellers in the AF. 

#### 29. Can members of the Singapore community visit the Appointed Facilities? 

Members of the Singapore community are allowed to visit the Appointed Facilities to conduct meetings with travellers. There will be floor-to-ceiling dividers separating travellers from local visitors, and both locals and travellers will have to abide by the prevailing national Safe Management Measures (SMMs). 

#### 30. Can I leave the Appointed Facility during my stay?

Travellers are not allowed to leave the Appointed Facility throughout the duration of their stay. 

#### 31. Can I use the Appointed Facility to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) as a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident?

No. Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents who wish to exit the Appointed Facility (AF) and remain in Singapore will need to serve a further 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities, regardless of the duration of time spent at the Connect@Singapore AF. An individual’s time spent in the AF is not considered SHN, as they may interact with other high-risk travellers during their stay.

<div id="DepartSG"></div>

## Departure from Singapore

#### 32. I need a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR and/or serology test prior to leaving Singapore. Where can I take it?

Please make the necessary arrangements with your Appointed Facility. 

<div id="AF"></div>

## Appointed Facilities

#### 33. What are the responsibilities of the Appointed Facility?

The Appointed Facilities (AFs)’ main responsibilities include applying for the traveller’s entry into Singapore, and working with an MOH-approved healthcare provider to implement stringent testing requirements. The AF is also accountable for the travellers throughout their stay in Singapore, particularly ensuring their compliance with the testing regime, adherence to Safe Management Measures (SMMs), and staying within the AF.

#### 34. How were Appointed Facilities assessed and appointed for the Connect@Singapore initiative?

The Government assessed all proposals for Appointed Facilities (AFs) based on their ability to ensure strict segregation of travellers from the local community and robustness in Safe Management Measures (SMMs) to minimise the risk to public health. Other criteria such as prior experience as a government-contracted facility for COVID-19 purposes, and the hotel/facility’s track record in adhering to prevailing SMMs were also considered. 

#### 35. Are Partial Appointed Facilities allowed? 

Partial Appointed Facilities (AFs), where only part of the property is used as an AF, are allowed if they are able to set up designated areas for AF operations, in a manner that totally segregates the AF travellers from the local community, alongside ensuring robust Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place. Partial AFs are required to implement tight systems and controls to ensure travellers remain within the segregated zone and abide to the required SMMs. All Appointed Facilities will be regularly audited by STB.  

#### 36. How long will the pilot for the Connect@Singapore initiative last?

We will monitor the outcomes of the pilot with the selected Appointed Facilities, and take-up of the initiative, before deciding on the next steps.

<div id="enforcement"></div>

## Enforcement of Health Protocol 

#### 37. How will the health protocols for the Connect@Singapore initiative be enforced? What are the penalties if Appointed Facilities breach Safe Management Measures (SMMs) or health protocols? 

STB will conduct regular audit and enforcement checks on Appointed Facilities (AFs) to ensure compliance with Safe Management Measures (SMMs). Enforcement action will be taken against AFs who are not compliant or take in travellers without approval.

Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 Apr 2020, first-time offenders who contravene SMMs or MTI conditions may be fined up to $10,000, imprisoned up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders may be fined up to $20,000, imprisoned up to twelve months, or both. Businesses that are not compliant may be ordered to cease business activities or close altogether. Businesses that do not comply may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance, and may be barred from participation in  the Connect@Singapore initiative and future pilots.

#### 38. What are the penalties if travellers breach Safe Management Measures (SMMs) or health protocols?

Non-compliant travellers, such as those who miss their scheduled PCR tests, may be prosecuted under the Infectious Disease Act (IDA) and/or the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020. Appointed Facilities (AFs) will flag non-compliant cases to ICA for necessary enforcement action to be carried out, such as revocation of visit pass and serving SHN+ to travellers pending repatriation. 

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who breach Safe Management Measures (SMMs) or health protocols under the Connect@Singapore initiative may be fined and/or jailed under the IDA and/or Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020.


<div id="tourism"></div>

## Tourism 

#### 39. What would be the expected gains for Singapore’s tourism sector from the implementation of the Connect@Singapore initiative? 

The Connect@Singapore initiative aims to support the revival of Singapore’s air hub status and hospitality sector, and facilitate essential global business exchanges. As the scheme is currently launched as a pilot, the immediate impact is expected to be modest.
