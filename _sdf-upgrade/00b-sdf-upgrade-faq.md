## Upgrading to an SDF Suite at Additional Costs 

#### 1.	Who can I share the room with? 

Travellers who are married couples or immediate family (i.e. grandparents, parents, spouse, parents-in-law, siblings or children) may request to stay together. 

#### 2. Is there a maximum number of travellers that a suite can accommodate? 

Different SDFs have different caps on the maximum number of persons that can be accommodated in a suite. Larger families may be asked to be accommodated in separate rooms, or interconnecting rooms (if available).

Travellers are strongly advised to verify with the SDF if the suite can accommodate the expected number of persons before confirming the booking.

#### 3.	Can I book a suite from an SDF that is not listed here?  

No, only booking confirmations from the SDFs listed here will be accepted.

#### 4.	Can I transfer to a suite if I am currently serving SHN in an SDF? 

Yes, travellers who are currently serving SHN in an SDF may book a suite with one of the SDFs listed. 

However, travellers should note that they will be charged additional costs of up to $450 ($300 for specialised cleaning costs of the vacated room; $150/vehicle for transport to next SDF) for transfers requested mid-way through their SHN stay. 

#### 5.	Can I transfer to a suite from any SDF?  

Yes, travellers can transfer from any SDF to a suite under the SDFs listed here, regardless of which SDF they are currently serving SHN in. 

#### 6.	How much will I be charged if I am already serving my SHN in a SHN dedicated facility (SDF)? 

Travellers will be charged a pro-rated cost for the suite, based on the number of nights spent at the suite, if they request to be upgraded mid-way through their SHN stay. 

In addition, travellers will also be charged additional costs of up to $450 ($300 for specialised cleaning costs for the vacated room; $150/vehicle for transport to next hotel) for their transfers. 

For example, total costs for a traveller who transfers to a suite on Day 2: [2/14 * $2k at existing SDF] + [12/14 * $6k at the regular suite] + $450 = $5.9k (rounded up). 

#### 7.	I am interested in serving my SHN in one of the suites listed here. How do I go about booking one? 

Travellers should directly contact the SDFs in the list to enquire on availability and make a booking. 

Travellers should obtain a copy of the booking confirmation from the SDF, and submit a form at <https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuiteupgrade> to inform government agencies of the booking. 

#### 8.	Do I need to inform anyone after I have booked my suite? 

Yes, travellers should submit a form at <https://go.gov.sg/sdfsuiteupgrade> to inform government agencies of the booking. 

Failure to do so may result in your assignment to a standard room at any SDF upon your arrival. 

#### 9.	How do I pay for my suite? 

Travellers who have booked a suite prior to arrival should make payment for the suite directly to the SDF upon check-in. Travellers who fail to make payment will be centrally assigned to another SDF.

Travellers who are transferring to another suite mid-way through their SHN stay should make payment for the suite to the existing SDF at check-out. 

#### 10.	I have already made payment to my sponsoring Government agency for the costs of my SDF stay. Do I still need to make payment to the SDF at check-in?

Travellers who have made payment to sponsoring government agencies when obtaining approval to enter Singapore will be required to pay the difference in the cost of upgrading to an SDF suite. This additional amount will be paid to the SDF at check-in. 

For example: If traveller has already paid $2k to an agency when obtaining approval to enter Singapore, and later decides to upgrade to a Regular suite at Fairmont Singapore before arrival, the traveller will need to pay the balance of $4k to Fairmont Singapore at check-in.

#### 11.	Can I make any changes to my suite booking? 

If you have to make changes to your suite bookings, please first contact SDF to ensure that there is suite availability. Subsequently, please the submit a form at <https://go.gov.sg/changesuiteupgrade> to inform government agencies of your updated details.  

Please do not make multiple suite bookings. SDFs will be asked to cancel all bookings if a traveller is found to have made multiple bookings.
