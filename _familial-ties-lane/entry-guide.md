This guide is meant for travellers who have received their approval letters to travel to Singapore via the Singapore Citizen/Permanent Resident Familial Ties Lane (FTL). Returning SC/PRs should refer to [this page](/sc-pr/requirements-and-process) instead, and travellers who have yet to apply for any entry approvals may click here for the list of available Safe Travel Lanes.

Travellers should familiarise themselves with the indicative travel health control measures ([here](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/shn-and-swab-summary)) imposed based on their 21-day travel history to various countries/regions, before embarking on their journey to Singapore. Regardless of whether the traveller has recovered from, or vaccinated against COVID-19, these measures generally include any combination of the following (click on the links below for more information, including costs):

### 1. Pre-Departure Requirements

A) <u>Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</u>

Travellers who have visited any high-risk country/region in the past 21 days before departure for Singapore are required to present a valid negative PDT result for entry. Travellers are only exempted from this requirement, if they have stayed in a low-risk country/region for <u>21 consecutive days</u> before departure for Singapore. Click [here](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/shn-and-swab-summary) to find out if a pre-departure test (PDT) is required before travelling to Singapore.

Travellers requiring a PDT must take the test <u>within 72 hours before their departure for Singapore</u>. The test must be taken at an [accredited or authorised testing facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country/region of departure, and travellers should ensure that the PDT:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Reflects the date and result of the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”).</li> 
</ol>

B) <u>Submission of Declarations & Registration for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test</u>

Travellers who are fit for travel must:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Submit an SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/">here</a></li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, if they are arriving via air (<a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/">register here</a>), sea or land (<a href="https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton">register here</a>)</li>
</ol>

Travellers are also advised to activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">WhatsApp</a> mobile applications on their mobile phones which will facilitate SHN compliance checks and contact tracing. Travellers who are Work Pass holders should also download the [FWMOMCare](http://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/foreign-manpower/fwmomcare/fwmomcare-user-guide.pdf) app.

C) <u>Application for Entry Visas</u>

Valid entry-visa holders and visa-exempted travellers are not required to apply for an entry visa to enter Singapore. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa, or wish to apply for a visa may [click here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements) for more information.

### 2. Departure for Singapore

During pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked to produce a valid approval letter. 

Travellers who have visited any high-risk country/region in the past 21 days before departure for Singapore, must also present a [valid negative PDT report](#PDT) during pre-boarding checks, otherwise they may be denied boarding. [Click here](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/shn-and-swab-summary) to check if a PDT is required.
