All travellers are required to take a PDT before arrival in Singapore, except those who:
- Are below the age of three in this calendar year; or
- Have remained in only Category (I) and (II) country/regions in the past 21 consecutive days before departure for Singapore; or

<a href="/scpr-familial-ties-lane/shn-and-swab-summary">Click here</a> to check if your travel history requires you to take a PDT.  Travellers are required to take their PDT at an [accredited or authorised testing facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country/region of departure and ensure that the PDT:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.</li>
</ol>

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 PCR test before their departure can contact the Safe Travel Office <a href="/contact-us">here</a>.

B) <u>Submission of Declarations & Registration for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test</u>

Travellers who are fit for travel must:

<div id="sgac"></div>

  </table>

Strict enforcement action, including prosecution under the Penal Code and Infectious Diseases Act, will be taken against individuals who breach the SHN requirements or make false declarations. Upon conviction, errant travellers may be liable to a fine and/or imprisonment term.

Travellers should note that any prior approvals given to complete the SHN at a place of residence may be rescinded should the public health risk assessment change. In such an event, the prevailing travel health control measures would apply, i.e. serving SHN at an SDF.


### 2. Departure for Singapore

During pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked to produce a valid approval letter.

All travellers with a travel history to any [Category (III) and (IV) country/region](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/shn-and-swab-summary) in the past 21 days before arriving in Singapore, must also present a [valid negative PDT report](#PDT) report during pre-boarding checks, otherwise they may be denied boarding.


### 3. Arrival in Singapore

A) <u>Immigration Clearance</u>

Travellers with a travel history to any [Category (III) and (IV) country/region](scpr-familial-ties-lane/shn-and-swab-summary) in the past 21 days before arriving in Singapore, who are unable to produce a valid negative PDT report may be denied entry into Singapore and could have their passes revoked.

Depending on the traveller’s 21-day travel history, they will receive their SHN via the email provided in the [SGAC declaration](#sgac). Travellers who have visited multiple countries/regions in the past 21 days before entering Singapore, will be subject to the strictest set of travel health control measures. For example, if traveller had visited a Category (I) and (III) country/region in any of the past 21 days before arrival in Singapore, the Category (III) measures will apply regardless of the duration stayed in each location (includes transits).

B) <u>COVID-19 Tests</u>

Travellers must take their on-arrival [COVID-19 test(s)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) and commute directly to their self-isolation accommodation or SDF immediately. Travellers who did not [pay for their test(s) before arrival](#sgac), will pay on the spot.

B) <u>Transport to Self-Isolation/SHNs</u>

Travellers are prohibited from using public transport (i.e. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) to commute to their self-isolation/SHN accommodation or SDF. Depending on the traveller’s SHN arrangement, they have the following transport options, which will apply throughout the SHN period:

### 4. Self-isolation, Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

Travellers must remain in their accommodation of self-isolation or SHN/SDF, until after they are ascertained to be free of COVID-19.

All SHN-serving travellers will be scheduled by the relevant government agency to take a COVID-19 PCR test at the end of the SHN period. Travellers who do not receive their COVID-19 PCR test appointment details a day before the scheduled test should write to STO via this [webform](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry) for assistance. In addition to the COVID-19 PCR test, travellers with a travel history to a Category (III) or (IV) country/region will be required to self-administer an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on Days 3, 7 and 11 on arrival in Singapore. Only travellers with a travel history to a Category (I) to (III) country/region and have been allowed to serve their SHN at an accommodation of choice is exempted from the need to self-administer an ART.

Depending on the volume of tests conducted that day, the result of the COVID-19 PCR test is generally released to the traveller after about 24 hours from when the test was administered. The result could be conveyed to the traveller via a call or SMS. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the [HealthHub App](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices).  Any traveller who is tested positive for [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) will be sent for treatment immediately;

Travellers who test positive for [COVID-19](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-symptoms) will and must undergo [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.
