Singapore Minister for Transport, S Iswaran, had a meeting this morning with Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Edward Yau, on the Singapore â€“ Hong Kong Air Travel Bubble (ATB). Given the evolving COVID-19 situation in Singapore, Mr Iswaran and Mr Yau agreed that the ATB flights originally planned for 26 May will be deferred.
 
Both sides remain strongly committed to launching the ATB safely. However, in light of the recent increase in unlinked community cases, Singapore is unable to meet the criteria to start the Singapore-Hong Kong ATB. Both sides therefore agreed to defer the launch of the ATB to protect the health of travellers and the public in these two places.
 
Singapore and Hong Kong will closely monitor the public health situation in both places and review the new launch date of the ATB flights towards the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in Singapore.
 
Travellers may still continue their journey on non-designated ATB flights. However, such travellers will be subject to the prevailing border control and health requirements of both places. Singapore residents returning from Hong Kong will be subject to a 7-day Stay-Home Notice upon entry into Singapore.
 
The airlines will be contacting affected passengers to render assistance. Passengers may also reach out to their airlines regarding their travel plans.
