#### 1. What is the SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement for travel to Singapore?

The SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement is a non-transferrable document which allows a traveller to seek a single-entry, short-term essential business and official visit into Singapore within a stipulated week (0000 hours Monday to 2359 hours Sundays), and to remain in Singapore for the duration of the visit pass issued at the immigration counters in Singapore.

SafeTravel Passes are approved on a limited basis to mitigate the risk of imported COVID-19 cases.
