#### 18. What documents do I need to produce to the airlines for pre-boarding checks and checkpoint counters for immigration checks?

RGL travellers by air and land are required to produce the following documents to the airlines for pre-boarding checks and immigration counters for immigration checks:
- A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry to Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter).
- A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore).
- A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be issued by an authorised COVID-19 testing facility designated by the government of the country/region the traveller is departing from.) The certificate should also be in English or accompanied by an English translation.
- Proof of transportation arrangements to depart from Singapore (e.g. air, train and bus return ticket). Travellers arriving by air who do not produce a return air ticket during pre-boarding checks may be refused boarding.

### **Testing Arrangements Upon Arrival in Singapore**

#### 19. What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Singapore? Where will the tests be administered? What are the payment modes accepted for the tests?

Travellers will be directed to take COVID-19 PCR tests upon arrival at Changi Airport, Seletar Airport, Woodlands or Tuas Checkpoints in Singapore. To qualify for exemption from the Stay-Home-Notice (SHN) requirement, travellers must take the COVID-19 PCR test at the assigned swabbing station within the airport and land checkpoints. Please approach the airport ground staff and land checkpoint authorities upon arrival for assistance. 

Travellers entering Singapore by air are encouraged to pre-register and pre-pay for the COVID-19 PCR test. Pre-registration and pre-payment can be made on Changi Airport’s Website [here](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/). Travellers should expect to pay around S$196 (inclusive of GST) for the COVID-19 PCR test.

Travellers entering Singapore by land will make payment at the testing station located at Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints. Only card payments or PayPal are accepted. Travellers should expect to pay around S$150 (inclusive of GST) for the COVID-19 PCR test.

#### 20. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore? 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will be accorded medical treatment. Short-Term Pass holders will be accorded the necessary medical treatment at his/her own cost. 

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who travel on permitted travel arrangements may access government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Pass holders who travel on permitted travel arrangements may tap on the usual financing arrangements, such as foreign worker insurance. Travellers should furnish the relevant supporting documents to indicate such arrangements. 

### **Health Measures in Singapore**

#### 21. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore? 

Travellers must take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore and remain isolated in a declared self-sourced accommodation until their test results are released (typically within 48 hours). The traveller’s declared accommodation during the first 14 days of their stay in Singapore must not be a residential address.  Transportation from the airport/land checkpoints to the declared accommodation will have to be provided by the host company or government agency subject to prevailing health measures<sup>1</sup>.  Travellers will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for the traveller’s stay in Singapore. The traveller may not use public transportation for this purpose, except for private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport<sup>2</sup>. 

Travellers to Singapore must use the TraceTogether app and SafeEntry<sup>3</sup>, take twice daily temperatures, report their health status to the host company or government agency, and adhere to prevailing public health requirements for the duration of stay in Singapore.

#### 22. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app? 

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data. 

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/).

#### 23. What is SafeEntry?

SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FIN and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

More information on the system can be found [here](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/).

### **Returning to Countries/Regions of Departure**

#### 24. Do I need to be tested again in Singapore before I return to my origin country/region of departure? Do I need to be quarantined or tested again upon return to my country/region of departure?
