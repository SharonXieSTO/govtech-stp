<i>[Readers who have arrived on this page directly from a search engine or are new to the entry-requirements imposed by Singapore during the pandemic, should start from the <a href="/arriving/overview">“Travelling to Singapore” </a>page. Travellers who do not meet the entry-requirements will be turned away from Singapore.]</i>

### Travel Checklist – Death & Critical Illness Emergency Visit Lane	

This checklist is **only** suitable for travellers who have been approved for entry on an urgent basis via the Death and Critical Illness Emergency Visit Lane (DCEV). Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or travellers who had left Singapore for Malaysia via DCEV should refer to the lane specific requirements or refer to their approval letters for instructions. Return to “Travelling to Singapore” for more details. 

Given the nature of the visit, arrangements will be made to allow travellers to make short and safe visits to the medical facility and/or funeral. Otherwise, scroll-down or click on the links for health-related protocols applicable based on the relevant stage of your journey.

Travellers may print out this page and indicate with a **"&#9745;"** in the box **(&#x2610;)** for completed activities.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

&#x2610;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must write to Safe Travel Office with the relevant supporting documents for approval to enter Singapore via DCEV. Click [here](/dcev/overview) for more details.

&#x2610;  <i><b>B) Application for Entry Visas</b></i>

Travellers who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long Term Pass holders holding passports issued by visa-required countries/regions should apply for an entry visa. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa or wish to apply for a visa may <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements" target="_blank">check the main ICA site</a> for more information.

<div id="stage1c"></div>

&#x2610; <i><b>C) Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</b></i>

Travellers must take a PDT **within 2 days before departure** for Singapore, unless they:

### Stage 4: Self-Isolation, Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#x2610;  <i><b>A) Serve Self-isolation / Stay-Home Notice (SHN))</b></i>

SHN-serving travellers will be required to take additional COVID-19 tests during the SHN period. Where applicable, the test requirements will be communicated to the traveller.

Travellers who wish to leave their self-isolation/SHN accommodation, or SDF for facilitated visits to funerals/wakes or hospitals must have a negative PCR result within the last 72 hours of the visit,  before they can leave their SHN/SDF location. The cost of the tests will be borne by the travellers and paid directly to the test providers. Those who are unable to comply with the pre-visiting testing requirement will not be allowed to leave their SHN/SDF location.

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will receive the necessary <a href="/health/covidtreatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>, and the prevailing treatment charges would apply.

&#x2610; <i><b>B) Visits to Medical Facility / Funeral</b></i>

For travellers who received approval to leave their SHN location for short visitations (details of visitation conditions will be conveyed to the travellers separately), the following transport arrangements apply:
- **Travellers who are serving SHN at SDFs** are to make transport arrangements at their own cost from Strides Transportation Pte Ltd. Refer to Stage 3C above, for details.
- **Travellers who are serving SHN at other SHN location**s (i.e. self-sourced accommodation, place of residence) may self-drive using their own private vehicles or be driven by the same family member who picked them up from the airport. These travellers may also book private hire vehicles. Refer to Stage 3C above for details.


### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#x2610;  <i><b>A1) Early release from Stay-Home Notice (SHN) (if applicable)</b></i>

Travellers who wish to leave Singapore before the end of the SHN period **due to exceptional circumstances**, please submit a request via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>, with the category “Stay Home Notice Accommodation” and sub-category “Appeal to leave SHN for Exceptional Reasons”. An exit COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test will be required.

&#x2610; <i><b>A2) Regular release from Self-isolation / Stay-Home Notice (if applicable)</b></i>

<b>For travellers serving SHN at an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)</b>, the checkout timing will be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF and they can only leave after the SDF staff have informed them to do so. 

<b>Travellers serving SHN at a place of residence </b> will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction ("PCR test") before the end of the SHN. Travellers who do nto receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. Travellers may end their SHN arrangements upon receipt of a negative test result or when they complete the 7 -day or 10-day SHN period applicable to them, whichever is later. The result of the test will be communicated via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank"> HealthHub App</a> .

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/covidtreatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> 

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, <a href="/health/vtsg#VDSMM" target="_blank">click here to check how to get your vaccinated status recognised in Singapore.</a> 

Travellers should also use the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
