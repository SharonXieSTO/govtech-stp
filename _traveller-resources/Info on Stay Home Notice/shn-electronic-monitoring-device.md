### Setup and Usage

Some travellers may be asked to utilise an Electronic Monitoring Device (EMD) from the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) during their Stay Home Notice (SHN) period to ensure compliance. The EMD includes a paired gateway device and wristband that travellers must wear throughout the SHN period (image below). To use the EMD, travellers must also download the StayHome@SG mobile application.

Using Bluetooth signals, the EMD will alert the relevant authorities to errant travellers who leave their declared SHN accommodation before the end of the SHN period. As such, travellers should ensure that their EMD is properly set up. Travellers should refer to <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stayhomesg-user-setup-guide.pdf" target="_blank">this guide</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKhawlenncA" target="_blank">video</a>, <a href="/images/stayhomesg-infographics-1.png" target="_blank">infographic</a> or <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stay@homesg-faqs.pdf" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, for set up instructions.

All EMDs issued by ICA are not equipped with audio or video recording capabilities – personal privacy is therefore protected. All location data is transmitted via end-to-end encryption and can only be accessed by authorised government officials for investigation.

It uses Bluetooth signals and alerts the authorities if the distance between the wristband and gateway at home is beyond a pre-defined range but cannot relay the exact current location of its wearer.

It also has other features, including a sensor that will trigger alert should the wearer tampers or removes the smartwatch.

### Return of Gateway Device after SHN

Travellers will be contacted at the end of their SHN period by ICA for the return of their gateway device. They may, however, dispose the wristband based on existing <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/e-waste-management/where-to-recycle-e-waste">e-waste disposal methods.</a>.
