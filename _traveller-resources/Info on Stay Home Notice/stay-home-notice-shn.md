Only some Safe Travel Lanes to Singapore require travellers to serve an SHN, if they have travel history to certain countries/regions. If you need information on what Safe Travel Lanes to use and whether a Stay Home Notice will be imposed when you enter Singapore, please start from the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore</a> page instead to find out more.

### SHN Requirements

The Stay-Home Notice (SHN) is a legal notice issued under the Infectious Diseases Act that requires travellers to remain in their place of residence or <a href="/health/shn/sdf" target="_blank">SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)</a> for a stipulated period. The failure to comply with any SHN requirement is punishable under Singapore laws and can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional penalties such as the cancellation of long-term visit passes could also be taken against errant individuals by the relevant authorities.

In general, travellers under SHN are required to take a mandatory <a href="/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest" target="_blank">COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR Test”)</a> towards the end of their SHN. <b>Travellers can check their required SHN duration and required <a href="/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest" target="_blank">COVID-19 tests</a> on the individual <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">SafeTravel Lanes pages</a></b>. Travellers approved for entry into Singapore should refer to their Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass for details on whether they are required to serve their SHN and COVID-19 test to take.

Travellers issued with an SHN should refer to the conditions inside the SHN, and watch the video below for a quick overview of SHN requirements. Travellers who have questions regarding their SHN may also refer to the <a href="/health/faq#shnsdf" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section</a> . Those in need of additional support can refer to <a href="https://www.gov.sg/article/call-these-helplines-if-you-need-emotional-or-psychological-support" target="_blank">this page</a> for a list of local helplines and resources.

### SHN Start and End Date

SHN will begin <b>immediately</b> from the time the notice is issued on the day of the traveller's arrival in Singapore. It will remain in effect until the traveller is notified of a negative test result from the final PCR test taken at the end of the SHN. 

Travellers serving their SHN at a place of residence or self-sourced accommodation may end their SHN immediately upon receipt of the negative PCR test result at the end of their SHN. 

For travellers serving SHN in an SDF, <b>the SDF will inform the traveller of the check-out time after it receives confirmation of the negative COVID-19 test result from the relevant government agency</b>. Travellers will only be allowed to leave the SDF thereafter. 

Reflected in the table below are two examples of indicative SHN durations. You may also <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">use this SHN Calculator</a> to calculate the estimated end date of your SHN.

### SHN Compliance Checks

Travellers issued with the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be subjected to on-site or electronic compliance checks (SMS, phone/video calls) from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) or Ministry of Education (MOE). Travellers should note that officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identity. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked to provide the last four digits of his/her Identity Card or Travel Document for verification. Any payment request made by the caller may be a scam. Travellers with SHN issues may call the SafeTravel Helpline at 6812 5555 for further enquiries or assistance.

### SHN Electronic Monitoring Device

Some travellers may be issued with an Electronic Monitoring Device (EMD) from ICA during their SHN period to ensure compliance. Users are required to download the StayHome@SG mobile application (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/stayhome-sg/id1517984071" target="_blank">App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hitachi.shn_mobile&hl=en_SG&gl=US" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>) to use the EMD, which comprises of a paired gateway device and wristband (image below). Travellers must wear the wristband throughout the entire duration of their SHN. 

<img src="/images/ica-wristband.jpg" style="width:auto; height:auto;">

The EMD will alert the relevant authorities to errant travellers who leave their declared SHN accommodation before the end of the SHN period. As such, travellers should ensure that their EMD is properly set up. Travellers should refer to <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stayhomesg-user-setup-guide.pdf" target="_blank">this guide</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKhawlenncA" target="_blank">video</a>, <a href="/images/stayhomesg-infographics-1.png" target="_blank">infographic</a> or <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/covid-19/stay@homesg-faqs.pdf" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, for instructions on EMD set up and troubleshooting issues with the EMD.

All EMDs are not equipped with audio or video recording capabilities – personal privacy is therefore protected. All location data is transmitted via end-to-end encryption and can only be accessed by authorised government officials for investigation.

Travellers will be contacted by ICA at the end of their SHN period for the return of their gateway device. They may, however, dispose the wristband based on existing <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/e-waste-management/where-to-recycle-e-waste" target="_blank"> e-waste disposal methods</a>.
