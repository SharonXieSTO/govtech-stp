TraceTogether is a technological solution to combat the spread of COVID-19 via contact tracing. All travellers will be required to utilise the TraceTogether app, or obtain a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.

<u>Children aged 6 years or younger in the current calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.</u>

### 1.	Installing TraceTogether App or Obtaining TraceTogether Token

#### A)	TraceTogether App 

Prior to arriving in Singapore, travellers should check that their mobile devices are compatible with the TraceTogether app, download it on their mobile devices, and register their mobile number and profile on the app. Travellers must register their profile on the app with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that they are using to enter Singapore. A TraceTogether (TT) App setup guide for travellers can be found [here](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/1500002071841-I-m-travelling-to-Singapore-How-do-I-set-up-the-TraceTogether-App-). 

<b>Visitors who are unable to download the TraceTogether App on their mobile devices should consider renting a TraceTogether-compatible mobile device once they have entered Singapore.</b>

Visitors must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on their TraceTogether app holding screen immediately after they have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore and follow the instructions to activate the app.

#### B)	TraceTogether Token

Starting from 1 Jan 2022, Short-Term Visitors can obtain TT tokens with a payment of S$13 per token, from the <a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/getting-around/tourism-centre/" target="_blank">Singapore Visitor Centre at Orchard Gateway</a> (open from 10am-7pm daily), or any of the TT Token collection booths found at the community centres. The community centre booths and their operating hours can be found at <A href="https://token.gowhere.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://token.gowhere.gov.sg</a>.

Payment can be made via PayNow, EZ-link, Nets Flashpay, Mastercard, VISA, JCB, and Union Pay. Cash payments are not accepted.

<b>Short-Term Visitors may collect or replace Tokens on behalf of family/friends at the Token counters at Community Centres. Visitors will be required to provide the Token owner’s passport and mobile number for verification purposes when collecting and replacing the tokens.</b>

	
### 2.	Using TraceTogether

#### A)	TraceTogether App Users

To facilitate contact tracing, travellers must keep the TraceTogether app activated on their mobile devices while in Singapore. A traveller must upload all data in the TraceTogether app upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health should he/she test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

#### B)	TraceTogether Token Users

To facilitate contact tracing, travellers are required to carry their own tokens with them wherever they go, and not exchange their tokens with others. Each token is uniquely tagged to the individual that registered for it. Authorised personnel may ask to retrieve the token should he/she tests positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

Tokens will be replaced free-of-charge if they stop working due to (1) battery lifespan, (2) manufacturing defect or (3) damage not due to visitor’s negligence. Otherwise, replacements are subject to the same fee.
