## Stay Home Notice (SHN) and Dedicated SHN Facility

<!--#### 1. Am I required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN)? How long is the SHN?

The duration of your SHN, if required, depends on your travel history prior to arrival in Singapore, and Safe Travel Lane used. Please check the page [here](/arriving/overview) on the Safe Travel Lanes available depending on your traveller profile and travel history.

The length of your SHN will be stipulated in the Entry Approval Letter or Safe Travel Pass issued.

<div id="shnsdfQ2"></div>

#### 2. My place of residence is unsuitable for me to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Where can I book an accommodation to serve my SHN?

Travellers without a suitable place of residence for SHN may make a direct reservation with a suitable hotel from this <a href="https://sha.org.sg/stay-home-notice" target="_blank">list</a>. Before a room booking is made, travellers must inform the hotel that they are serving a SHN and ensure that the hotel can accommodate them.

<div id="shnsdfQ3"></div>

#### 3. I am presently serving my Stay-Home Notice (SHN). How do I obtain my daily necessities?

An SHN is a legal notice issued under the Infectious Diseases Act, which directs its recipients to remain in their place of residence or [SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF)](/health/shn#sdf) <u>at all times</u> for a stipulated period. Any breach in SHN requirements is punishable under Singapore’s laws and additional penalties such as the revocation of a Work Pass may also be taken by the relevant authorities.

Travellers should note that basic essentials such as water, cleaning supplies as well as daily meals (three times a day based on dietary preference) will be provided by the SDF. Should you require extra food and essentials, you may opt for home delivery services or enlist the help of others. When collecting these items, please refrain from collecting them personally. If you have other specific needs during the SHN period you may call the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at **6812 5555**.

#### 4. When does the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) generally begin and how would I know if it has ended?

The SHN commences from the time the notice is issued to the traveller on arrival in Singapore and will be in effect until the traveller is notified of a negative result from the final COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) <u>at the end of SHN</u>. The duration of the SHN will be stated on your SHN document, and you can also [click here](/shn-calculator) to calculate the end date of your SHN. 

Travellers who are serving SHN at their own place of residence may end their SHN after they have received confirmation of a **negative** result for the SHN exit PCR tests.

Travellers who are staying in SDF will be alerted by the SDF concierge on their check out time when they have received confirmation of the PCR test result.-->

#### 1. What should I do if I need to attend to an emergency before checking into my Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF)?

As a condition for entry into Singapore, all travellers must commute directly to their SHN accommodation or SDF **immediately** after clearing immigration. The failure to do so constitutes a breach of the SHN requirements which is punishable under Singapore’s laws.

In the event of an emergency, travellers may contact the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at **6812 5555** for assistance and advice.

#### 2. Am I permitted to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF) of my choice?

Due to the fast-changing demands for SDFs, travellers will be assigned to an available SDF upon arrival. Travellers who wish to book an SDF suite at a specific hotel at an additional cost may [click here](/health/shn/sdfupgrade) for more information.

#### 3. I’m travelling with my extended family and have some specific lodging needs. Can I ask for room adjustments?

Travellers already in SDF may contact the concierge at the Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF) first for help. 

For travellers who are not yet in Singapore or for request that the SDF is unable to facilitate, e.g. caregiver support, SDF opt-out, travellers may wish to refer to [this page](https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds) for more details. Travellers may also contact the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at **6812 5555** for assistance and advice


#### 4. I previously received approval to serve my SHN at my own place of residence instead of at an SHN Dedicated Facility. However, I discovered I am unable to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at my earlier declared SHN accommodation. What should i do? 

Travellers who encounter difficulties serving their SHNs at their declared SHN accommodation may refer to this [page](https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds) for more details, or contact the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at **6812 5555** for assistance and advice.

## Transport Advisories

<div id="transportQ2"></div>

#### 1. What are the transport advisories for Travellers with Category (I), (II) or  (III) travel history, and are self-isolating or completing their Stay Home Notice at their accommodation?

Travellers of these categorycan commute using their own private vehicle, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or book a private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL(TADA)) via the provider's respective apps. 

<div id="note1"></div>
	
(i) <u><b>Private Transport Use</b></u>

Travellers may be picked up from the airport by an authorised hotel and transport service representative/family member from the same household/friend in a private vehicle. However, there should not be more than one person picking up the traveller, and the traveller must be ferried directly to their declared place of accommodation.

If there is more than one traveller, those sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and are heading towards the same declared place of accommodation.

All persons in the vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. In addition, the following precautions are strongly encouraged:-

<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>Vehicle windows must be wound down with air conditioning turned off.</li>
		<li>Where practicable, the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied;</li>
			<li>The back seat should only be occupied by the traveller(s)</li>			
			<li>The driver should wipe down the vehicle after dropping the traveller off at his/her declared place of accommodation. Please refer to the National Environmental Agency (NEA) <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/advisory-on-surface-cleaning-and-disinfection-for-covid-19">guidelines</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>

<div id="note2"></div>

(ii) <u><b>Taxi/private-hire vehicles</b></u>

When securing a transport booking, travellers must inform the transport operator as well as driver that they are served with a <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn">Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</a>. Travellers that opt to arrange for transport using a mobile application may key “<i>SHN</i>” in the chat/note/comment box or by checking the SHN checkbox (if provided within the app). Travellers that board a taxi/private hire car should sit alone in the back seat, with windows down and air-conditioning turned off.

Only travellers with the same travel history and heading to the same declared place of accommodation are allowed to share a taxi/private-hire vehicle, subjected to permitted passenger capacity in the back seat.

All travellers are prohibited from taking public transport, e.g. public buses/trains.

<!--<div id="transportQ3"></div>

#### 2. [For travellers with Category (IV) travel history] Due to personal circumstances, I have obtained approval to serve SHN at my place of residence/hotel/ serviced apartment. What are the types of transport that I can take?

Travellers who have obtained approval to serve SHN at their own accommodation **must** make a transport booking with the transport provider Strides Transportation (Tel: 6477 5977). For booking instructions, click <a href="/files/stridesbooking.pdf">here</a>. The following costs will apply, which will be borne by the traveller.

## COVID-19 Tests for Travellers (including COVID-19 Recovered Travellers)

#### 1. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. Do I need to be tested for COVID-19 before travelling and how long before my departure should I be tested?

The testing requirement will be stated in the traveller's <b>Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass.</b> As these requirements are determined based on the traveller's travel schemes, prospective travellers should visit the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">"Travelling to Singapore"</a> page for details. 

In general, travellers required to be tested before their flight will be required to do so <u>within 2 days before departure to Singapore</u> and produce documentary proof of having been tested. Failing which, they may be denied boarding or turned away. See examples below on the acceptable duration for which a test should be taken: 

<b>Direct Flights:</b> If the PDT is taken on <b>1 November 2021</b>, it will be valid for departures (for air/sea checkpoints) or arrivals (for land checkpoints) <b>up to 3 November 2021, 2359 hours.</b>

<b>Connecting Flights to Singapore:</b> If the passenger's flight itinerary is LAX-NRT-SIN and the transit period at NRT is <u>less than 24 hours</u>, he must take his COVID-19 test within <u>2 days</u> before the scheduled departure of his flight from LAX. Should he remain at NRT for <u>more than 24 hours</u> for his connecting flight to Singapore, he will take a pre-departure test at NRT.

<!--#### 2. I am transiting via Singapore. Do I still need to have a valid negative COVID-19 test result?

Click <a href="/transit/overview#PDT">here</a> for the relevant details.-->

#### 2. Can I travel to Singapore if I do not have a valid negative Covid-19 test certificate?

As a condition to enter Singapore, travellers must produce a negative COVID-19 test result. This may be enforced by the airline/transport operator during pre-boarding checks. Unless there are other compelling reasons, travellers failing to meet this condition will be denied entry into Singapore.

Travellers may only enter if there are compelling reasons. Individuals who present falsified COVID-19 test certificates will be dealt with accordingly, and may be barred from future entry applications.

<div id="recovered"></div>

#### 3. I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. When can I travel into Singapore?

Travellers who are unwell or recently diagnosed with [COVID-19](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs) should defer their travels. 

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, airlines will deny travellers from boarding an aircraft if they have a recent diagnosis of COVID-19, i.e. first diagnosis made 14 days or fewer from date of travel. Travellers should only schedule their trip to Singapore 14 days after the first diagnosis and after they have fully recovered from COVID-19. 

<div id="pcrtestQ5"></div>

#### 4. I have recovered from COVID-19. Am I required to be tested for COVID-19 before departure for Singapore?

If a COVID-19 test is required to be taken <u>2 days</u> before departure, i.e. a condition for entry into Singapore, travellers must take the test regardless of whether they have recovered from COVID-19. 

Travellers will be denied boarding by their airline or ferry if they are:
- diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 14 days or less, from the date of travel; and/or
- tested positive on the COVID-19 test within <u>2 days</u> before departure for Singapore.

<!--<div id="testresult"></div>

#### 6. How will I be informed of my COVID-19 test result at the end of SHN?

Hardcopy/softcopy of the COVID-19 test result will not be issued. Travellers who are Work Pass Holders (and their dependants) will receive their results via SMS or email. All other travellers will receive their swab test results via email. However, travellers who test positive will be informed via phone call and further assistance will be provided. 

Travellers with a SingPass account may login to [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices) to view their swab test results once available.

#### 7. Can I refuse the COVID-19 test in Singapore?

As a condition for entry into Singapore, travellers may be required to take a COVID-19 test while in the country. These conditions would be made explicit during application and reiterated to the traveller again, by way of a condition stipulated in their Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass. 

Action will be taken against travellers who fail to comply with any of the stipulated requirement/condition for entry into Singapore. This may amount to a fine and/or imprisonment term as prescribed in the Infectious Diseases Act. Additional penalties such as revocation of Work Pass may also apply.

#### 8. Do I have to complete my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) if I have been tested negative for COVID-19 before departing to Singapore?

Yes, travellers must complete their SHN even after they are tested negative for their COVID-19 test before departing to Singapore. You may refer to the illustrations [here](/health/shn) on the general duration of your SHN.-->

#### 5. I am travelling with my child. Is my child required to be tested for COVID-19 before entry into Singapore? Are infants exempted?

Travellers arriving from countries requiring a COVID-19 test must do so if they are three years old and above this calendar year. Individuals below the age of three this calendar year are, by default, exempted from this testing requirement. 

#### 6. Why do children need to take the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)?

Regardless of age, infected individuals can transmit [COVID-19](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs) to other members of the community if undetected. As part of border health control measures to detect cases early and minimise the public health risk of community transmission, COVID-19 testing is extended to inbound travellers aged 3 and above (in that calendar year). 

#### 7. My child is very sensitive/has frequent nosebleeds. Can he/she be excused from the SHN+ exit swab?

In Singapore’s context, the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) is carried out by trained personnel in adherence with the prevailing safety protocols/procedures. Should your child be assessed to have medical contraindications and is unsuitable for the PCR test, alternative arrangements may be made.

<!--#### 12. I am unwell. Can I postpone my COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) appointment?

Travellers who are due to take their PCR test but are feeling unwell should remain in their [Stay-Home Notice (SHN)](/health/shn) accommodation, e.g. own residence or [SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF)](/health/shn#sdf), and alert the relevant agencies listed in this [page](https://go.gov.sg/tc).-->

<div id="outboundPDT"></div>

## Outbound Pre-Departure Test and Health Certificates for Travellers Departing from Singapore

#### 1. I have been vaccinated in Singapore. Am I still required to take a pre-departure test to leave the country?
Travellers who have been vaccinated in Singapore should check with the authorities of the destination country/region, on whether they are still required to take a pre-departure test before arrival. Non-vaccinated individuals (including children) who intend to travel should likewise check on the prevailing border and health control measures they should abide by in the destination country/region.

#### 2. Do clinics need to help travellers digitally authenticate and endorse their HealthCerts?

No, the traveller should digitally authenticate and endorse their HealthCerts themselves at https://www.notarise.gov.sg . When issuing the HealthCerts to them, clinics, labs and/or the tech provider should also highlight the requirement to the traveller. In the event that the tech providers are already performing digital authentication and endorsement via Application Programming Interfaces (API), travellers will receive an endorsed document without having to transact on the Notαrise portal.

<!--#### 3. The PRC embassy stipulates both PCR and serology IgM tests for all travellers entering China. Since the HealthCert is currently only for PCR tests, how will travellers meet the entry requirements?

The combined PCR and IgM HealthCert will be available soon. In the meantime, travellers should highlight to the clinic if their PDT is for the purposes of entry to China, in which case they should be issued with an additional paper certificate in accordance with the PRC embassy’s requirements. [This page](/departing/overview#PDT) will be updated accordingly when the combined schema is available.-->

#### 3. The country/region I am travelling to requires a test other than a PCR test. Since the HealthCert is currently only for PCR tests, how will travellers show their test results to the relevant authorities?

In such a case, the traveller may request for a hardcopy test result from the doctor to show to the airlines and immigration authorities of the arrival country/region.

#### 4. How will travellers receive their Pre-Departure Test (PDT) certificate?

The test results will be sent to the traveller by either the clinic where the PDT was taken, or by their partnering clinical laboratory. This will be in the form of a digital certificate in accordance with the HealthCerts schema and standards. In the event the traveller does not have the ability to show the digital certificate on arrival at the destination country/region, the traveller may request for a hardcopy from the doctor.

#### 5. Can travellers still use digital certificates without a SingPass account (e.g. foreign citizen who is a short-stay traveller)?

Travellers may still digitally authenticate and endorse their test certificate on www.notarise.gov.sg without signing in to SingPass. However, please note that the traveller will only be receive the endorsed HealthCert via email, with no additional copy stored in the SingPass mobile app.

#### 6. What if the digitally authenticated and endorsed certificate was not sent to the traveller?

Please check the email spam folder. If the email is still not there, please contact . 

#### 7. Can a third party transact on behalf of a traveller who requires the assistance to digitally authenticate and endorse their PDT certificate?

Yes, a third party may do so if they have the digital certificate of the traveller(s) that they will be transacting on behalf of.

#### 8. Where can GP clinics find out more about digital certificate capabilities and providing PDTs?

Clinics may refer to the following circulars on the MOH website: [Mandating Digital Health Certificates for COVID-19 Pre-Departure Testing](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/mandating-digital-health-certificates-for-covid-19-predeparture-testing), and [Extension of Deadline for Digital Health Certificates for COVID-19 Pre-Departure Testing](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/extension-of-deadline-for-digital-health-certificates-for-covid19-pre-departure-testing)

#### 9. Where can I see my vaccination records? 

Vaccination records are kept electronically in the National Immunisation Registry, as well as on apps such as TraceTogether and HealthHub. You can also refer to your physical vaccination card that is given to all vaccinated individuals. These are for your own reference, to check if you are vaccinated.

<!--#### 11. Can I use my physical vaccination card for travel purposes? 

The physical vaccination card that is given to all vaccinated individuals is not meant to be used for travel purposes. We are actively engaging international counterparts and monitoring global developments on the development and recognition of digital vaccination certificates for travel purposes. Travellers should also take note of the latest travel advisory for Singaporeans and residents of Singapore published by <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19">MOH</a>.

#### 12. How can I prove to foreign authorities that I have been vaccinated? 

The physical vaccination card that is given to all vaccinated individuals is not meant to be used for travel purposes/ proof of vaccination. For purposes of travel, you can request for a digital vaccination certificate from <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg">Notαrise</a>. This will be sent to your email and/or Singpass app, and can also be printed out. Please be aware that the use of this digital vaccination certificate is subject to the prevailing entry requirements of your destination country. 

Travellers should check the <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.sg/where-are-you-travelling-to">MFA website</a> for the latest travel advisories to other countries/ regions, as well as the immigration authority or embassy of the destination country/ region on the relevant health requirements imposed on travellers from Singapore. Travellers should also take note of the latest travel advisory for Singaporeans and residents of Singapore published by <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19">MOH</a> .-->
