### COVID-19 Travel Insurance

#### Mandatory Insurance for Short-term Visitors

All short-term visitors applying to enter Singapore via the [Air Travel Pass (ATP)](/atp/overview),  [Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs)](/rgl/overview) and [Vaccinated Travel Lane (Air)](/vtl/requirements-and-process) will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 (based on COVID-19 bill sizes at private hospitals). This is a requirement regardless of the traveller's vaccination or recovery status, as there is still a risk that these travellers can get a COVID-19 infection and require medical attention.

The travel insurance will help with the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. Please ensure sufficient coverage as travellers will have to pay for their own treatment costs beyond their insurance coverage.

Visitors should <u>purchase such travel insurance prior to travelling to Singapore</u>, either from Singapore-based or overseas insurers. 

A list of available Singapore-based travel insurance products* are as follows:

<b><i>All Short Term Visitors entering via [ATP](/atp/overview), [RGL](/rgl/overview) and [VTL (Air)](/vtl/requirements-and-process) are required to prepare an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to bring with them to facilitate their entry into Singapore. </i></b>

The mandatory travel insurance <u>does not</u> apply to Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents (SCs/PRs), as they are able to access Government subsidies and MediShield Life / Integrated Shield Plans to help pay for their medical bills, should they develop onset of symptoms for COVID-19 within 14 days of their return.

#### Insurance for Long-Term Pass Holders

Employers must buy COVID-19 medical insurance for all (both new and existing) Work Permit, Training Work Permit and S Pass holders, before they enter Singapore. Please refer to <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/entry-approvals-for-foreign-employees-and-shn-requirements#what-are-the-covid-19-insurance-requirements-for-workers-entering-singapore" target="_blank">MOM’s website</a> to check the coverage required or <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/eligible-claims-and-medical-benefits#where-can-i-buy-covid-19-insurance">where to buy</a> the insurance from.

For all other pass holders (e.g. Employment Pass holders or dependants), they are encouraged to buy medical insurance with the appropriate coverage <b>before entering Singapore</b>. They are responsible for their own medical expenses if they develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival in Singapore.

### Medical Treatment Facilities for COVID-19

COVID-19-positive patients who are assessed to be ineligible for home recovery may be conveyed to and accorded the necessary medical treatment at a suitable COVID-19 care facility. These facilities can be public and private hospitals, COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) and/or Community Isolation Facilities (CIFs), depending on the patient’s condition.

<u>Patients may not choose the specific hospital or facility to be treated at</u>, and all decisions to convey the patient to the appropriate COVID-19 care facility made by the Government of Singapore will be final.

Patients who are first admitted to a hospital for COVID-19 management may subsequently be transferred to a CTF or CIF for continued care. Such patients will be medically managed at the facility until they are fit for discharge.

Patients who deliberately refuse treatment or leave the facility before a formal discharge, or otherwise behave in a manner that exposes others to the risk of infection, may be prosecuted for offences under the Infectious Diseases Act. Upon conviction, the offender may be imprisoned and/or fined.
