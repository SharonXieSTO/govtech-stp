### COVID-19 Tests for Travel to Singapore

This page provides information on the various COVID-19 tests to be taken when travelling to Singapore.

Where COVID-19 tests are required as part of travel health measures, travellers aged 3 and above in this current calendar year (i.e. born in 2018 or before) departing for Singapore will also be subjected to COVID-19 tests.

The health measures to be imposed may not be limited to COVID-19 tests, and you should check the requirements of your respective <a href="/arriving/overview">Safe Travel Lane</a> for full details.


#### 1. PCR Test before Departing to Singapore

Travellers may be required to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) pre-departure test 48 hours before departing to Singapore.  If so, travellers are required to take their PDT at an [internationally accredited or recognised lab/clinic/medical facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country/region of departure. They should also obtain a copy of the test result that meets the following conditions, as it will be used as proof that the traveller had been tested for COVID-19:
- Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
- Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and
- Reflects the date and result of the PCR test. 

Travellers who fail to produce the required documentary proof of a valid negative pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test may be denied boarding or turned away.
