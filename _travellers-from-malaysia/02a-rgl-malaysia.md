## Travellers Returning to Singapore after RGL travel in Malaysia

Singapore-based travellers returning from their travel to Malaysia on the Reciprocal Green Lane will be exempted from the prevailing SHN policy applicable to incoming travellers to Singapore, if they:

- Undertake a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport/checkpoint at their own cost upon arrival in Singapore and remain in isolation until they have been notified of their on-arrival test results. For air arrivals, you are strongly encouraged to pre-register and make advance payment for the PCR test via this link to minimise processing time at the airport: https://changiairport.com/safetravel/; and
- Produce the MyTravelPass issued by the Malaysia Immigration Department which confirms that he/she was granted approval to travel under the Reciprocal Green Lane (Malaysia) to ICA at Singapore Immigration;
- You may wish to refer to https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19 for the latest details and updates on border control measures as well as https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/ArrivalSG for information on the prevailing health measures for inbound travellers.

Please disregard the electronic SHN which you may receive via email upon submission of the Electronic Health Declaration through ICAâ€™s SG Arrival Card e-Service, provided that the conditions above are met. If the above conditions are not met, travellers will be subjected to the prevailing health regulations in Singapore upon arrival in Singapore, including the requirement to serve SHN. For more information about the SHN issued by ICA, please refer to https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/shn.
