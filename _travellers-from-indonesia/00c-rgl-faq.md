## **Application Process for Residents in Indonesia**

### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? 

Indonesian Citizens who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel from Indonesia to Singapore for business or official purposes.

#### 2. I am a Singapore Citizen / Singapore Permanent Resident / Singapore Long-Term Pass holder who is resident in Indonesia. Am I eligible to apply for the RGL to travel from Indonesia to Singapore? 

Under the RGL, only Indonesian Citizens who need to make essential business or official travel are allowed to travel from Indonesia to Singapore. These would include Indonesian citizens who are also Singapore Permanent Residents or Singapore LongTerm Pass holders.   

#### 3. What is a SafeTravel Pass?

A SafeTravel Pass is required for travellers from Indonesia to seek entry into Singapore under the RGL. It is non-transferable and will be valid for a single entry into Singapore anytime within the stipulated week (0000hrs Monday to 2359hrs Sunday). Travellers must enter Singapore within this stipulated week, and can stay in Singapore for up to 10 days.  
 
SafeTravel Passes will be issued on a limited basis in order to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases. 
 
Please send an email to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> if you have further queries related to the SafeTravel Pass

#### 4. How do applicants in Indonesia apply to travel to Singapore under the RGL? What are the steps from the time I put in an application to the time I obtain a SafeTravel Pass? How long is the processing time? What documents do I need to submit? 

Applicants in Indonesia seeking to travel to Singapore for essential business or official travel via the RGL must be hosted by a company or a government agency in Singapore. The host company can file the application for a SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller either directly at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>, or through a sponsoring government agency.<sup>1</sup>

The application for the SafeTravel Pass will be open 2 to 5 weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure. The processing of the application can take up to 7 working days (excluding the day of application).  
 
You are encouraged to apply for the SafeTravel Pass as early as possible, factoring in the time necessary for the processing of the SafeTravel Pass application, and taking a pre-departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test before departure for Singapore. 
 
When the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be issued to the sponsoring company / government agency by email. Singapore’s visa-free entry policies prior to COVID-19 will apply for Indonesian Citizens travelling under the RGL.       
 
The approved applicant will have to submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations as well as declare his/her accommodation electronically via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eserviecs.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), within 3 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore. 
 
Prior to the traveller’s departure from Indonesia, the sponsoring company or government agency should submit the traveller’s certificate of negative result for COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure and latest controlled itinerary in Singapore at <http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. 
 
The traveller is required to present his/her valid SafeTravel Pass, certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test (in English), a  valid return air/ferry ticket or proof of other transport arrangements to depart from Singapore for pre-boarding checks at the airlines/ferries check-in counter and immigration counter. Otherwise, he/she may be refused boarding. Ferry passengers with symptoms, i.e. febrile or visual signs of acute respiratory infection, will be turned back on the next ferry trip upon detection at the ferry terminal in Singapore. 

#### 5. What are the responsibilities of the host company? 

When a company applies for the SafeTravel Pass on behalf of the traveller, it is also responsible for the timely submission of the accompanying documents. 
 
The host company should also ensure that the traveller abides by the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Indonesia RGL, and the prevailing health measures during his/her stay in Singapore. Authorities may ask for proof of adherence to the controlled itinerary, including physical verification or SafeEntry Pass records (e.g. screenshots), and other terms and conditions when the traveller is in Singapore.  
 
You can access the terms and conditions of the Singapore-Indonesia RGL [here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/indonesia/rgl/terms-and-conditions). Action will be taken against the traveller and the host company in the event of non-compliance. 

#### 6. Can tourists apply for SafeTravel Passes? 

SafeTravel Passes are only issued to travellers making short-term essential business and official travel. These passes are not applicable for tourists. 
 
#### 7. Can my SafeTravel Pass be transferred to my family member, friend, colleague or business partner? 

SafeTravel Passes are not transferable to others.

#### 8. Do I need to pay to apply for a SafeTravel Pass? 

No payment is required. 

#### 9. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass? 

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a SafeTravel Pass. Every entry to Singapore requires a new SafeTravel Pass application. 
 
If the traveller’s SafeTravel Pass has expired, he/she should submit a new application. One traveller can only hold one valid SafeTravel Pass for a single entry into Singapore at any one point in time. Please refrain from submitting multiple SafeTravel Pass applications or submitting new applications when you already have a valid SafeTravel Pass on hand. Duplicate applications will be rejected. 

#### 10.  What happens if I do not comply with the terms and conditions for the SafeTravel Pass? 

The Singapore Government takes a serious view of non-compliance with SafeTravel terms and conditions and prevailing health measures. Non-compliance will result in enforcement action taken against the traveller, including not being able to apply for travel under the RGL again.   

#### 11. What is the duration of stay that I will be eligible for in Singapore? 

A traveller using the RGL scheme may stay for up to 10 days in Singapore. 

#### 12. My travel plans have changed/some information in my application is incorrect. How can I amend the details of my SafeTravel Pass application/approved SafeTravel Pass?

Both the SafeTravel Pass application and issued SafeTravel Pass cannot be amended. Please ensure that all details of the application form are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 13.  What can I do if I have changes to my controlled itinerary? 

The host company or government agency should be responsible for monitoring and reporting any deviation in your controlled itinerary. The host company or government agency should resubmit the updated controlled itinerary on behalf of the traveller via the ‘Submission of Supporting Documents for SafeTravel Pass Application’ Form, at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please have the approved STP reference number and documents on hand for submission, and ensure that the amendments or deviation from the controlled itinerary are in accordance with the stipulated guidelines. 
 
#### 14.  Can the sponsoring company / agency or traveller check the status of the SafeTravel Pass application? 

The sponsoring company/agency or traveller may make enquires about the status of their application(s) at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO>. Please prepare the traveller’s identification details and intended date of entry into Singapore as declared in the STP application.  
 
#### 15. Why was my application rejected? 

SafeTravel Pass applications may be rejected for reasons, including the following: 
 - Inadequate justifications provided for reason of travel.
 - Non-compliant controlled itinerary submitted. 
 - Wrong proof of residency submitted.
