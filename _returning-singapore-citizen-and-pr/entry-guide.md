This entry guide is meant for Singapore Citizens (SC) and Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) who have decided to return to Singapore. Returning SC/PRs can return to Singapore <u>without</u> the need for any Entry Approvals.

Before their return, returning SC/PRs should familiarise themselves with the indicative travel health controls measures which are imposed based on their 21-day travel history, which can be <a href="/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf">accessed here</a>. These measures generally include any combination of the following (click on the links below for more information, including costs):

</ol>

Returning SC/PRs are also encouraged to access <a href="">this page</a> for the latest information on the changes in travel health control measures imposed to mitigate the spread of <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-symptoms">COVID-19</a> in the community.

### 1. Pre-Departure for Singapore (within 72 hours before departure)

<i>A) <u>COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) within 72 hours before departure</u></i>

Travellers departing for Singapore from 27 May 2021, 2359 hours onwards are required to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR pre-departure test(PDT) that they had taken <u>within 72 hours before departure to Singapore</u>. The test must be taken at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing">accredited or authorised testing facility</a> in the country/region of departure. This, however, only applies to the following categories of travellers who have visited a high-risk country/region in the past 21-consecutive days before arrival in Singapore (click here to check if a PDT is required):

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Returning SCs who are arriving in Singapore via <u>air or sea</u>; and</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Returning PRs who are arriving in Singapore via <u>air, land or sea</u>.</li>
</ol>

Transport operators may deny travellers without a PDT negative result from boarding. Permanent residents and long-term pass holders who do not comply, may be turned back or have their permits or passes cancelled on arrival in Singapore. To avoid this, travellers should obtain a copy of their COVID-19 PCR test report that:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.</li>
</ol>

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 PCR test before their departure can contact the Safe Travel Office via this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">Enquiry Form</a> or 6812 5555.

<i>B) <u>Submission of Declarations & Registration for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test</u></i>

Travellers who are fit for travel must:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Submit an SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/">here</a></li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;  line-height:1.5;">Register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, if they are arriving via air (<a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/">register here</a>), land or sea (<a href="https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton">register here</a>)</li>

Travellers are also advised to activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">WhatsApp</a> mobile applications on their mobile phones which will facilitate SHN compliance checks and contact tracing. 


### 2. Departure for Singapore

All travellers defined at Section 2(A), must present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test during pre-boarding checks, otherwise they may be denied boarding.

### 3. Arrival in Singapore

<i>A) <u>Immigration Clearance</u></i>

All PRs who arrive in Singapore without a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test may be denied entry into Singapore and could have their Entry/Re-entry Permits cancelled.

Depending on the traveller’s 21-day travel history, they will receive their SHN via the email provided in their SGAC declaration. Travellers who have visited multiple countries/regions in the past 21 days before entering Singapore, should note that the strictest set of measures will apply. Travellers who do not receive an SHN will be required to remain in self-isolation until a negative COVID-19 PCR test result is conveyed.

<i>B) <u>COVID-19 Tests</u></i>

Travellers will take an on-arrival COVID-19 test, including an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) if applicable, and commute directly to their self-isolation accommodation or SDF immediately. Travellers who have yet to pay for their test(s) before arrival, will pay on the spot.

<i>C) <u>Transport to Self-Isolation/SHN</u></i>

Travellers are prohibited from using public transport (i.e. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) to commute to their self-isolation/SHN accommodation or SDF. Depending on the traveller’s SHN arrangement, they have the following transport options, which will apply throughout the SHN period:

### 4. Self-isolation, Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 PCR Tests

### 5. Completion of Self-isolation/SHN

Travellers under self-isolation or serving SHN at their own residence may leave their accommodation when a negative COVID-19 test result is conveyed. 

For travellers serving SHN at an SDF, the checkout timing would be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF.

Travellers must comply with the prevailing public health-related and safe distancing measures. This includes the use of the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> app, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
