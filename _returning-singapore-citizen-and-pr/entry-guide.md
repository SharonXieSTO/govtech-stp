This entry guide is meant for Singapore Citizens (SC) and Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) who have decided to return to Singapore. Returning SC/PRs can return to Singapore <u>without</u> the need for any Entry Approvals.

Before their return, returning SC/PRs should familiarise themselves with the indicative travel health controls measures which are imposed based on their 21-day travel history, which can be accessed <a href="/sc-pr/shn-and-swab-summary">here</a>. These measures generally include any combination of the following (click on the links below for more information, including costs):

</ol>

<b>Please note that travellers who have received COVID-19 vaccination or recovered from COVID-19 are currently subjected to the prevailing health measures.</b>

<div id="PDT"></div>

### 1. Pre-Departure for Singapore (within 72 hours before departure)

A) <u>Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</u>

<b>SCs and PRs returning to Singapore by flight or ferry</b> and <b>PRs entering Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link</b> are required to present a valid negative PDT result for entry into Singapore. SCs entering Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link do not need a PDT but will be subject to the prevailing travel health control measures. 

For flights and ferry trips departing from <b>27 June 2021, 2359hrs (1559 hrs GMT)</b>, the PDT requirement will also apply to travellers aged three and above (in this calendar year). Travellers who meet the conditions below will be exempted from this requirement:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Leaving for Singapore before 27 June 2021, 2359 hrs (1559 hrs GMT), and are below the age of six (i.e. born in or after 2015); or</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions for 21 consecutive days before departure for Singapore. </li>
	</ol>

Click <a href="/sc-pr/shn-and-swab-summary">here</a> to find out if a pre-departure test (PDT) is required before you board.

Travellers requiring a PDT must take the test <b>within 72 hours before their departure for Singapore</b>. The test must also be taken at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing">accredited or authorised testing facility</a> in the country/region of departure, and travellers should ensure that the PDT:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.</li>
</ol>

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 PCR test before their departure can contact the Safe Travel Office via this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">Enquiry Form</a> or 6812 5555.

<div id="SGAC"></div>

B) <u>Submission of Declarations & Registration for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test</u>

Travellers who are fit for travel must:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Submit an SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/">here</a></li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, if they are arriving via air (<a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/">register here</a>), sea or land (<a href="https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton">register here</a>)</li>
</ol>

Travellers are also advised to activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">WhatsApp</a> mobile applications on their mobile phones which will facilitate SHN compliance checks and contact tracing. 

C) <u>Request to complete the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at residence instead of SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF)</u>

Travellers may apply to serve their SHN at their own residence instead of an SDF <a href="https://go.gov.sg/scproptoutsdf">here</a>, if they have remained in the countries/regions specified in S/No. 3 of <a href="/sc-pr/shn-and-swab-summary">this list</a> for 21 consecutive days and are serving their SHN:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Alone, i.e. no domestic helper(s); or</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">With household members that share the same travel history and area also serving their SHN for the same duration and period.</li>
</ol>

Eligible travellers should submit their applications <b>at least three days before arrival in Singapore</b>. Strict enforcement action, including prosecution under the Penal Code and Infectious Diseases Act, will be taken against individuals who breach the SHN requirements or make false declarations. Upon conviction, errant travellers may be liable to a fine and/or imprisonment term. 

Travellers should note that any prior approvals given to complete the SHN at a place of residence may be rescinded should the public health risk assessment change. In such an event, the prevailing travel health control measures would apply, i.e. serving SHN at an SDF.


### 2. Departure for Singapore

All travellers with travel history to higher risk countries/regions taking a flight or ferry to Singapore, must present a valid negative PDT report during pre-boarding checks, otherwise they may be denied boarding (see page [here](/sc-pr/shn-and-swab-summary) to check if a PDT is required).


### 3. Arrival in Singapore

A) <u>Immigration Clearance</u>

All PRs who arrive in Singapore without a <a href="#PDT">valid negative PDT report</a> may be denied entry into Singapore and could have their Entry/Re-entry Permits cancelled.

Depending on the traveller’s 21-day travel history, they will receive their SHN via the email provided in their <a href="#SGAC">SGAC declaration</a>. Travellers who have visited multiple countries/regions in the past 21 days before entering Singapore, should note that the strictest set of measures will apply. Travellers who do not receive an SHN will be required to remain in self-isolation until a negative COVID-19 PCR test result is conveyed.

B) <u>COVID-19 Tests</u>

Travellers must take their on-arrival COVID-19 test(s), and commute directly to their self-isolation accommodation or SDF immediately. Travellers who did not pay for their test(s) before arrival, will pay on the spot.

C) <u>Transport to Self-Isolation/SHN</u>

Travellers are prohibited from using public transport (i.e. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) to commute to their self-isolation/SHN accommodation or SDF. Depending on the traveller’s SHN arrangement, they have the following transport options, which will apply throughout the SHN period:

### 4. Self-isolation, Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

### 5. Completion of Self-isolation/SHN

For travellers serving SHN at an SDF, the checkout timing would be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF.

Travellers must comply with the prevailing public health-related and safe distancing measures. This includes the use of the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> app, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
