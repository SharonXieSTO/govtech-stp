Strict enforcement action, including prosecution under the Penal Code and Infectious Diseases Act, will be taken against individuals who breach the SHN requirements or make false declarations. Upon conviction, errant travellers may be liable to a fine and/or imprisonment term.

Travellers should note that any prior approvals given to complete the SHN at a place of residence may be rescinded should the public health risk assessment change. In such an event, the prevailing travel health control measures would apply, i.e. serving SHN at an SDF.


### 2. Departure for Singapore

All travellers with travel history to any <a href="/sc-pr/shn-and-swab-summary">Category (III) and (IV) countries/regions</a> in the past 21 days before departing for Singapore, must present a valid negative PDT report during pre-boarding checks, otherwise they may be denied boarding.

### 3. Arrival in Singapore

A) <u>Immigration Clearance</u>

All PRs who arrive in Singapore without a <a href="#PDT">valid negative PDT report</a> may be denied entry into Singapore and could have their Entry/Re-entry Permits cancelled.

Depending on the traveller’s 21-day travel history, they will receive their SHN via the email provided in their <a href="#SGAC">SGAC declaration</a>. Travellers who have visited multiple countries/regions in the past 21 days before entering Singapore, should note that the strictest set of measures will apply. Travellers who do not receive an SHN will be required to remain in self-isolation until a negative COVID-19 PCR test result is conveyed.

B) <u>COVID-19 Tests</u>

Travellers must take their on-arrival COVID-19 test(s), and commute directly to their self-isolation accommodation or SDF immediately. Travellers who did not pay for their test(s) before arrival, will pay on the spot.

C) <u>Transport to Self-Isolation/SHN</u>

Travellers are prohibited from using public transport (i.e. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) to commute to their self-isolation/SHN accommodation or SDF. Depending on the traveller’s SHN arrangement, they have the following transport options, which will apply throughout the SHN period:

### 4. Self-isolation, Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

Travellers must remain in their accommodation of self-isolation or SHN/SDF, until after they are ascertained to be free of COVID-19.

All SHN-serving travellers will be scheduled by the relevant government agency to take a COVID-19 PCR test at the end of the SHN period. Travellers who do not receive their COVID-19 PCR test appointment details a day before the scheduled test should write to STO via this [webform](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry) for assistance. In addition to the COVID-19 PCR test, travellers with a travel history to a Category (III) or (IV) country/region will be required to self-administer an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on Days 3, 7 and 11 on arrival in Singapore. Only travellers with a travel history to a Category (I) to (III) country/region and have been allowed to serve their SHN at an accommodation of choice is exempted from the need to self-administer an ART. 

Travellers who test positive for [COVID-19](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-symptoms) will and must undergo [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.


### 5. Completion of Self-isolation/SHN

Travellers under self-isolation or serving SHN at their own residence may leave their accommodation when a negative COVID-19 test result is conveyed. For travellers serving SHN at an SDF, the checkout timing will be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF.

Travellers must comply with the prevailing public health-related and safe distancing measures. This includes the use of the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
