<b>From 28 May 2021, 2359 hours onwards</b>, PRs should show their <a href="/sc-pr/requirements-and-process#pdt">negative PDT result</a> during immigration clearance, in addition to regular immigration clearance procedures. <b><u>PRs who arrive in Singapore without a valid, negative PDT result may be denied entry into Singapore, and may have their Entry/Re-Entry Permit cancelled</u></b>.

<b>Singapore Citizens entering Singapore via the land checkpoints</b> do not need a PDT but will be subject to the prevailing health measures including on-arrival COVID-19 tests and SHN.

All travellers will take their <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest">on-arrival COVID-19 test(s)</a>. Travellers who have yet to pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test(s) will be required to pay on the spot.
