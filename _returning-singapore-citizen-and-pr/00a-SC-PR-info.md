All Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents arriving on designated ATB flights will be required to take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at Changi Airport.

After taking the test, Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents are required to take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their own accommodation. They must remain isolated at their accommodation until their test result is confirmed to be negative.

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year are not required to:
- undergo a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore; and
