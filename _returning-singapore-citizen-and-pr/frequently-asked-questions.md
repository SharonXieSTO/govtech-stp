#### 1.	I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. Do I need to take a pre-departure test before travelling to Singapore? 

From <b>XX May 2021, 2359 hours, <u>all</u> travellers entering or transiting through Singapore (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, i.e. SCPRs) via flight or ferry</b>, except for those who have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions<sup>1</sup> in the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours before departure before they are allowed to board their flight or ferry for travel for Singapore<sup>2</sup>.

<u>Note</u>:<br/><br/>
<sup>1</sup>This currently applies to travellers from Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Mainland China, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Macao. Travellers from lower-risk countries/regions are either required to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), or required to serve a 7-day SHN at their place of residence with a COVID-19 test administered at the end of their SHN.<br/><br/>
<sup>2</sup>For example, if a passenger is departing on 27 May 2021 1000hrs, the test must be taken no earlier than 24 May 2021, 1000hrs.



#### 2.	I am transiting via Singapore. Do I still need to have a valid negative COVID-19 test result?

From <b>XX May 2021, 2359 hours, <u>all</u> travellers transiting through Singapore (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, i.e. SCPRs)</b>, except for those who have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions in the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours before departure before they are allowed to board their flight for Singapore.
In addition, at this point in time, travellers will only be able to transit through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer route has been approved by CAAS. Travellers are encouraged to confirm with their airlines on their eligibility to travel. 

#### 3.	I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. What kind of COVID-19 tests will be accepted? 

Singapore only accepts test results from labs in the country that are <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing">internationally accredited or recognised</a> by the respective Government. 

The test result memo must state the negative test result in English, date that the test was taken, traveller/s name and either Date of Birth or Passport Number as stated in the passport, If the personal details used are not stated in the passport, the traveller should have the relevant identity document on hand for verification.

<!-- Are Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs) acceptable for the pre-departure testing requirement?

Currently, the PCR test is used in Singapore as the definitive test for the confirmation of COVID-19 cases. Antigen Rapid Tests will not be accepted for the pre-departure COVID-19 test. --> 

#### 4.	I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. When must my pre-departure test (PDT) be taken before the flight to be accepted for travel to Singapore?

All travellers entering or transiting through Singapore (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) via flight or ferry except for those who have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions in the last 21 days before departure for Singapore,  must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure before they are allowed to board their flight or ferry for travel for Singapore.  

<u>Direct flight</u><br/><br/>
For travellers who take a direct flight, the 72 hours will be counted from the scheduled departure time of the flight to Singapore.

<p style="line-height:1.5; color:red;"><i>**If a passenger is departing on 28 May 2021 1000H, PDT must be taken no earlier than 25 May 2021 1000H.</i></p>

<u>Connecting flights</u><br/><br/>
For travellers who have to take a connecting flight(s), the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the first leg only and the total transit duration for the trip must not be more than 24 hours. If the total transit duration is more than 24 hours, a PDT must be taken within 72 hours from the last leg (i.e. the flight to Singapore).

#### 5.	I am travelling with my child. Will my child be required to undergo a pre-departure test before entry into Singapore? Are children and infants exempted from the pre-departure test?

All travellers entering or transiting through Singapore (including SCs and PRs) via flight or ferry except for those who have stayed in lower-risk countries/regions in the last 21 days before departure for Singapore, will be required to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result before they are allowed to board their flight or ferry for travel for Singapore. This includes children aged 7 and above in that calendar year.

<p style="line-height:1.5; color:red;"><i>** Children who are born 2015 and before are required to take PDT to enter or transit through Singapore in 2021.</i></p>

#### 6.	I have recovered from COVID-19, am I required to undergo a pre-departure test before entry into Singapore? Will I be denied entry into Singapore?

Individuals who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection will still be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure for Singapore. 

Travellers will be denied boarding for flights or ferries bound for Singapore if:

<ul>
<li>they have a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days of less; or</li>
<li>tested positive on PDT within 72 hours before departure for Singapore. This also applies to individuals who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection over 22 days ago.</li>
</ul>

#### 7.	What will happen if I arrive in Singapore and do not have a valid negative PCR test certificate?

Travellers who arrive in Singapore (including via the land checkpoints) without a valid negative test result may be denied entry into Singapore.. PRs and long-term pass holders who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their permits or passes cancelled.

If non-citizen passengers are found to have produced false/forged COVID-19 test certificates, it will affect their ability to obtain or sponsor immigration facilities in the future.


#### 8.	Are travellers required to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result at land checkpoints when travelling from Malaysia to Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link? 

<b>PRs, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors</b> travelling from Malaysia to Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link must take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours of departing for Singapore.
 
Such travellers who arrive in Singapore without having a negative pre-departure test result as mentioned above may be denied entry into Singapore. Those who fail to comply with the new requirement may have their permits or passes cancelled.

<b>SCs</b> travelling from Malaysia to Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link will not be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test before departing for Singapore. However, they will still be subjected to prevailing border measures, i.e. an on-arrival PCR test and a 21-day SHN, with COVID-19 tests administered on Day 14 of their arrival, and before the end of their SHN.

#### 9.	Is there any appeal channel for Singapore Citizen/ PR to appeal for waiver of PDT if they are unable to pay for their PDT, or if there are no testing facilities/labs where travellers can have a COVID-19 PCR test conducted with results received within 72 hours of their departure?

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents may contact the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">Safe Travel Office</a> for advice if they are unable to afford or do not have access to COVID-19 PCR tests or timely COVID-19 PCR test results.
