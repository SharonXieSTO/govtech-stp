As part of Singapore’s efforts to reopen our borders safely, fully vaccinated* Singapore Citizens (SCs) and Permanent Residents (PRs) may now return to Singapore via the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) from the following countries/regions, <b>with effect from 8 September 2021, 0001 hours (Singapore time)</b>:

- Brunei Darussalam
- Germany

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do <u>not</u> need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) to travel to Singapore under the VTL, as they can return to Singapore without the need for entry approval provided they adhere to the VTL requirements.

*To be considered fully vaccinated, travellers must have received and completed the full regimen of the <a href="https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines">WHO EUL vaccines</a> (Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, oderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen, Sinopharm or Sinovac) in either Singapore or Germany, at least 14 days before their intended date of entry into Singapore. The following regimens are currently recognised:
- 1 dose of Janssen vaccine; or
- 2 same dose of the other WHO EUL vaccines; or
- Any other combination of doses of WHO EUL vaccines that is bilaterally agreed on between Singapore and their country/region of departure.*
