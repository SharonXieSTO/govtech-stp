<div id="eligibility"></div>

### (a) Eligibility Criteria

#### 1. I have an In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a Singapore-issued Long-Term Pass (i.e. Work Permit, Employment Pass, Student Pass, or Long-Term Visit Pass). Am I allowed to travel under the VTL (Land)?

IPA holders are not eligible to utilise the VTL (Land) for travel to Singapore. However, they may still travel to Singapore with necessary approvals under the <a href="/wphl/overview" target="_blank">Work Pass Holder General Lane</a> and will be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore, including any Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements.

#### 2. If I am a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident or Holder of a Singapore Long-Term Pass entering Singapore using the VTL (Land), can I use the VTL (Land) to return to Malaysia?

Travellers who use the VTL (Land) to enter Singapore can only return to Malaysia under the VTL (Land) if they meet the entry requirements for Malaysia, as follows:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Malaysia Citizen, Malaysia Permanent Resident, or holder of a Malaysia Long-Term Pass;</li>
<li style="line-height:1.5;">Fully vaccinated with a vaccine recognised by the Malaysia Ministry of Health;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Holds a proof of vaccination accepted by the Government of Malaysia;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Remains in Malaysia, any other VTL country as recognised by the Government of Singapore, and/or Singapore in the last 14 consecutive days before departing for Singapore; and</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Arrives in Malaysia on a designated VTL (Land) bus service.</li>
	</ol>

For more details, travellers should consult the <a href="http://www.myvtl.gov.my/" target="_blank">relevant authorities in Malaysia</a>. 

#### 3. If I am a Malaysia Citizen, Malaysia Permanent Resident or holder of a Malaysia Long-Term Pass entering Malaysia using the VTL (Land), can I use the VTL (Land) to return to Singapore?

All travellers are required to meet the eligibility criteria and entry requirements to enter Singapore under the VTL (Land), regardless of whether they used the VTL (Land) to enter Malaysia previously.

### (b) Designated VTL (Land) Bus Services

#### 1. Are travellers guaranteed a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore if they have a VTP?

<b>Having a VTP does not guarantee travellers a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore.</b> Travellers are responsible for obtaining their own tickets. Similarly, having a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore does not guarantee a VTP.

#### 2. Can I buy a ticket from a Malaysian VTL bus operator, or must I buy a ticket from a Singaporean VTL bus operator?

Travellers can purchase tickets for designated VTL (Land) bus services offered by either Singaporean or Malaysian designated operators for travel to Singapore. 

The list of designated VTL (Land) bus services is as follows:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Transtar Travel</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Handal Indah</li>
	</ol>

#### 3. Should I apply for a VTP first or should I book my bus tickets first? What happens if I do not require a VTP?

Travellers who require a VTP may wish to check on the availability of bus tickets for their preferred dates, before applying for a VTP. 

Those who do not require a VTP and meet the eligibility criteria can simply book a bus ticket to travel under the VTL (Land).

#### 4. Where are the boarding and disembarkation points for VTL (Land) bus services from Malaysia to Singapore, and from Singapore to Malaysia?

Travellers entering Singapore under the VTL (Land) will have to board the bus at Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The bus will arrive at Queen Street Terminal (for Handal Indah bus service) or Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange (for Transtar Travel bus service) in Singapore, via the Causeway.

Travellers entering Malaysia under the VTL (Land) will have to board the bus at Queen Street Terminal (for Handal Indah bus service) or Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange (for Transtar Travel bus service) in Singapore. The bus will arrive at Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, via the Causeway.

#### 5. Will the VTL (Land) bus services run daily? When are the earliest and latest VTL (Land) bus services?

There will be daily VTL (Land) bus services. Please refer here for the schedules of the VTL (Land) bus services. 

#### 6. I have a VTP and I meet all the requirements under the VTL (Land). However, I did not manage to get a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore if I drive my private vehicle, cycle, walk or take a non-designated bus service?

As required under the <a href="/vtl-land/conditions" target="_blank">VTL (Land) conditions</a>, a VTP holder must arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL (Land) bus service. All travellers who do not arrive on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore may be denied entry into Singapore and/or subjected to prevailing border measures.

Travellers who are allowed to enter Singapore will be subject to <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category (II) health measures</a> upon entry into Singapore.
