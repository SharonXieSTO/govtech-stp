<div id="eligibility"></div>

### (a) Eligibility Criteria

#### 1. I have an In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a Singapore-issued Long-Term Pass (i.e. Work Permit, Employment Pass, Student Pass, or Long-Term Visit Pass). Am I allowed to travel under the VTL (Land)?

IPA holders are not eligible to utilise the VTL (Land) for travel to Singapore. However, they may still travel to Singapore with necessary approvals under the <a href="/wphl/overview" target="_blank">Work Pass Holder General Lane</a> and will be subject to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore, including any Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 test requirements.

#### 2. If I am a Singapore Citizen, Singapore Permanent Resident or Holder of a Singapore Long-Term Pass entering Singapore using the VTL (Land), can I use the VTL (Land) to return to Malaysia?

Travellers who use the VTL (Land) to enter Singapore can only return to Malaysia under the VTL (Land) if they meet the entry requirements for Malaysia, as follows:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Malaysia Citizen, Malaysia Permanent Resident, or holder of a Malaysia Long-Term Pass;</li>
<li style="line-height:1.5;">Fully vaccinated with a vaccine recognised by the Malaysia Ministry of Health;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Holds a proof of vaccination accepted by the Government of Malaysia;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Remains in Malaysia, any other VTL country as recognised by the Government of Singapore, and/or Singapore in the last 14 consecutive days before departing for Singapore; and</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Arrives in Malaysia on a designated VTL (Land) bus service.</li>
	</ol>

For more details, travellers should consult the <a href="http://www.myvtl.gov.my/" target="_blank">relevant authorities in Malaysia</a>. 

#### 3. If I am a Malaysia Citizen, Malaysia Permanent Resident or holder of a Malaysia Long-Term Pass entering Malaysia using the VTL (Land), can I use the VTL (Land) to return to Singapore?

All travellers are required to meet the eligibility criteria and entry requirements to enter Singapore under the VTL (Land), regardless of whether they used the VTL (Land) to enter Malaysia previously.

<div id="DesignatedBus"></div>

### (b) Designated VTL (Land) Bus Services

#### 1. Are travellers guaranteed a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore if they have a VTP?

<b>Having a VTP does not guarantee travellers a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore.</b> Travellers are responsible for obtaining their own tickets. Similarly, having a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore does not guarantee a VTP.

#### 2. Can I buy a ticket from a Malaysian VTL bus operator, or must I buy a ticket from a Singaporean VTL bus operator?

Travellers can purchase tickets for designated VTL (Land) bus services offered by either Singaporean or Malaysian designated operators for travel to Singapore. 

The list of designated VTL (Land) bus services is as follows:
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Transtar Travel</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Handal Indah</li>
	</ol>

#### 3. Should I apply for a VTP first or should I book my bus tickets first? What happens if I do not require a VTP?

Travellers who require a VTP may wish to check on the availability of bus tickets for their preferred dates, before applying for a VTP. 

Those who do not require a VTP and meet the eligibility criteria can simply book a bus ticket to travel under the VTL (Land).

#### 4. Where are the boarding and disembarkation points for VTL (Land) bus services from Malaysia to Singapore, and from Singapore to Malaysia?

Travellers entering Singapore under the VTL (Land) will have to board the bus at Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The bus will arrive at Queen Street Terminal (for Handal Indah bus service) or Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange (for Transtar Travel bus service) in Singapore, via the Causeway.

Travellers entering Malaysia under the VTL (Land) will have to board the bus at Queen Street Terminal (for Handal Indah bus service) or Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange (for Transtar Travel bus service) in Singapore. The bus will arrive at Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, via the Causeway.

#### 5. Will the VTL (Land) bus services run daily? When are the earliest and latest VTL (Land) bus services?

There will be daily VTL (Land) bus services. Please refer here for the schedules of the VTL (Land) bus services. 

#### 6. I have a VTP and I meet all the requirements under the VTL (Land). However, I did not manage to get a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore if I drive my private vehicle, cycle, walk or take a non-designated bus service?

As required under the <a href="/vtl-land/conditions" target="_blank">VTL (Land) conditions</a>, a VTP holder must arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL (Land) bus service. All travellers who do not arrive on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore may be denied entry into Singapore and/or subjected to prevailing border measures.

Travellers who are allowed to enter Singapore will be subject to <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category (II) health measures</a> upon entry into Singapore.

<div id="Application"></div>

### (c) Application for the VTP

#### 1. Do travellers travelling with family members need to apply a VTP for every individual?

All travellers above the age of 12 years old in this calendar year who are not Singapore Citizens or Singapore Permanent Residents must apply for a VTP. 

Travellers who are aged 12 or below 12 years old in this calendar year are eligible to enter Singapore without a VTP, if they are travelling with an approved VTL (Land) adult and if they satisfy the other <a href="/vtl-land/conditions" target="_blank">VTL (Land) Conditions</a>.

#### 2. Is there an expiry (i.e. validity period) and limit to the number of times travellers can apply for a VTP?

No, there is no limit to the number of times a traveller can apply for a VTP. To afford entry flexibility to travellers, a VTP is valid for a period of up to 14 calendar days after the intended date of entry. This means that <b>a traveller holding a VTP for entry into Singapore on 1 December 2021, may book designated VTL (Land) bus service to enter Singapore on any day from 1 December to 15 December 2021. </b> 

Travellers intending to enter Singapore before or after the 14-day validity period should apply for a new VTP. 

#### 3. Once a VTP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the VTL (Land) conditions or even cancel the VTP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. This may result in changes to the VTL (Land) conditions or cancellation of the VTP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their VTP via email.

#### 4. Why was I unsuccessful in applying for a VTP?

A VTP application may be unsuccessful for reasons such as:

<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;"><a href="/vtl/faq#invalidcode" target="_blank">Invalid vaccination QR code</a></li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Passport validity is less than 6 months</li>
	</ol>

Those who are required to apply for a VTP and meet the eligibility criteria but cannot do so can write to the Safe Travel Office using the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">enquiry form here</a> and produce their vaccination certificate, travel documentation (e.g. passport) and other supporting documents.

#### 5. How do I change my declared particulars (e.g. mobile number, email address, self-isolation accommodation) on my VTP application?

If your particulars have changed, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">enquiry form here</a> with your revised particulars.

#### 6. How can I cancel my VTP as I no longer wish to travel to Singapore?

You do not need to cancel your VTP. If you do not utilise your VTP within the validity period, it will automatically expire.

### (i) Vaccination Requirement

<div id="proof"></div>

Persons who are above the age of 12 in the calendar year and medically unfit are not allowed to travel under the VTL (Land).

#### 2. What information needs to be reflected on the vaccination certificate?

The electronic or physical vaccination certificate(s) should be in English and clearly state the following:

<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">the traveller’s name, and at least one other personal identifier such as the date of birth, passport number or NRIC number corresponding exactly with the information in the traveller’s passport or NRIC used for entry into Singapore;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">the country/region of issuance must be any <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries" target="_blank">VTL country/region</a> or Singapore, regardless of which <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries" target="_blank">VTL country/region</a> they depart from;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">the name of vaccine used (if more than 1 dose, the name of each vaccine administered for each dose); and</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">the date(s) of vaccination (if more than 1 dose, the dates when each dose was administered). The date of the last dose should be administered at least 14 days before the traveller’s arrival in Singapore.</li>
	</ol>

#### 3. I was diagnosed with COVID-19 and have since recovered. I have also been vaccinated. Am I eligible to travel under the VTL (Land)?

If you have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC) issued by any VTL country/region showing the final dose in the series (i.e. “1/1” or “2/2”), you will fulfill the vaccination requirement under the VTL (Land). Holders of a Singapore Long-Term Pass may proceed to apply for a <a href="https://go.gov.sg/vtl-portal" target="_blank">Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) here</a> and upload the QR code found on their EU DCC of vaccination on the VTP application portal.

For all other travellers, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">enquiry form</a> and provide your proof of vaccination and recovery certificate.

#### 4. I was fully vaccinated in a non-VTL country/region and have since obtained a vaccination certificate issued by a VTL country/region / had my vaccination records ingested into Singapore’s National Immunisation Registry (NIR). Do I satisfy the vaccination requirement?

Yes, you will fulfill the requirement of having your proof of vaccination issued in any VTL country/region or Singapore.

If you are a holder of a Singapore Long-Term Pass with your vaccination records ingested into Singapore’s NIR, you may obtain your vaccination HealthCert issued via the <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise portal</a> and upload the QR code in your application for a VTP.

<div id="digitalcerts"></div>

### (b) Digitally Verifiable Vaccination Certificate and QR Code Issues

#### 1. What is a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate?

Digitally verifiable vaccination certificates should contain QR code(s) that can be scanned to read and authenticate that the QR code was issued by a trusted issuer and that the QR code belongs to the individual presenting it.

Non-digitally verifiable vaccination certificates (i.e. those that do not contain a QR code that we can scan to read and authenticate the traveller’s vaccination status) will not be accepted.

#### 2. What are the accepted forms of digitally verifiable vaccination certificates?
