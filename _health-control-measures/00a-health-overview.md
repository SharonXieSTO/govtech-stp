As the COVID-19 situation evolves, Singapore will continue to update our border measures, taking into account our understanding of the virus and the developments in other countries/regions.

Travellers planning to enter Singapore should be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border control measures and public health requirements. Details can be found in the pages related to arriving in Singapore.

Some countries also require Pre-Departure Tests prior to travellers leaving Singapore. Details on taking pre-departure tests can be found in the departure section of the health contorl measures.
