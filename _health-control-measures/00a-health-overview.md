As the COVID-19 situation evolves, Singapore will continue to update our border measures, taking into account our understanding of the virus and the developments in other countries/regions.

Travellers planning to enter Singapore should be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border control measures and public health requirements which are summarised in the document <a href="/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Details can be found in the pages related to arriving in Singapore.

Some countries also require Pre-Departure Tests prior to travellers leaving Singapore. Details on taking pre-departure tests can be found in the departure section of the health control measures.
