### 1. Obtain Entry Approval (If Applicable)

Make sure you have obtained approval for entry to Singapore via the various Safe Travel Lanes if required. Each Safe Travel Lane may have its own specific health requirements. If unsure what entry lanes and health requirements are applicable to you to enter Singapore depending on your country of departure and traveller type, please click [here](/arriving/overview) to find out more.

### 2. Visa Application (If Applicable)
ICA will resume the issuance of new visas from 18 October 2020, 2359 hours. Visitors who require a visa to enter Singapore can apply for visas through a local contact, Singapore Overseas Mission, or authorised visa agent. Check [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa) regarding visa requirements to enter Singapore.

Visitors who had already been issued with visas which are still valid, as well as those who are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, do not need to re-apply/apply.

Possession of a valid visa alone does not guarantee entry into Singapore. All short-term visitors must still seek prior approval via appropriate COVID-19 travel channels (e.g. obtain a Safe Travel Pass under Green/Fast Lane arrangements, or Air Travel Pass) before they can enter Singapore.

### 3. COVID-19 Test before departing for Singapore (If Applicable)
All Short-Term visitors, Long Term Pass Holders and In-Principle Approval holders with recent travel history to the following countries/places within the last 14 days prior to entry will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. These travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of approval to enter Singapore.

- Philippines*
- Indonesia*
- India

This requirement will apply on top of the existing requirements of a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at dedicated SHN facilities and a negative COVID-19 test before the end of their SHN.

Returning Singapore Citizens and PRs are not subject to this requirement.

*With effect from 19 October 2020, 2359 hours
