All travellers are required to comply with the prevailing public health regulations and requirements in Singapore. These may include (i) serving a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), and/or (ii) taking the COVID-19 test.


## Stay-Home Notice (SHN)

A Stay-Home Notice is issued, to all travellers who are granted entry into Singapore, as a precautionary measure taken to minimise the risk of additional imported cases of COVID-19.

The following groups of travellers will be exempted from the SHN requirement and subjected to COVID-19 test post-arrival in Singapore:

- All travellers who enter Singapore with a valid SafeTravel Pass ;
- Singapore residents holding a Malaysia-issued MyTravelPass (Reciprocal Green Lane);
- Singapore residents holding a Malaysia-issued MyTravelPass (Periodic Commuting Arrangement), and have an approved SHN waiver for short-term leave in Singapore;
- Foreign travellers who enter Singapore with a valid Air Travel Pass; and
- Singapore residents and Long-Term Pass holders (with Approval Letter of Entry) who spent at least 14 days prior to arriving from Australia (excluding Victoria State), Brunei Darussalam, New Zealand or Vietnam.

For those with extenuating circumstances, such as medical conditions or mobility issues that make it difficult for them to stay at their own accommodation or at an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), they should provide the details in this form at go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds.

For SHN-related enquiries or assistance, you may contact the SHN Helpline at 6812 5555.

Please visit go.gov.sg/govsg-shn for more information on SHN. Travellers that are serving their SHN are not allowed to leave their place of residence or SDF for the duration of the SHN period.

## COVID-19 Swab Test

Before the end of SHN, all travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 swab test at a designated community testing facility. Children aged 12 or younger (in that calendar year) need not take a COVID-19 swab test unless their close contacts are found to be COVID-19 positive.

Persons placed on SHN (PSHNs) will receive a call and/or SMS notification on their registered mobile number regarding the details of their allotted swab test appointment. PSHNs will be notified of the test result generally within 1 to 4 days after the day of the swab. PSHNs should continue to adhere to the terms of the SHN.

As Singapore's border restriction measures evolve with the global situation, you are advised to check the MOH's website for the latest updates.


## ICA's Electronic Monitoring Device

To aid ICA's efforts to enforce the SHN requirement, travellers entering Singapore from 10 August 2020, 2359hrs onwards, and are not serving their SHN at the SDFs, will be required to wear an electronic monitoring device.

This device must be worn for the full duration of the SHN period. Travellers aged 12 or younger (in that calendar year) are exempted from wearing the device.

**Issuance of ICA's Electronic Monitoring Device**
Eligible travellers will be given the following once they have cleared through Singapore's immigration checkpoints:

- Electronic wristband;
- Gateway device; and
- User Setup Guide.
Persons placed on SHN (PSHNs) who have received an electronic wristband are required to activate their wristbands upon reaching their place of residence/ accommodation where they will serve their SHN ("SHN residence"). Investigations will be conducted if the wristband is found to be damaged or tampered, and/or when a PSHN is found to have left his/her SHN residence.

## Enforcement measures

From the day of arrival in Singapore, ICA will be conducting mandatory checks on Singapore citizens, permanent residents, Long-Term Visit Pass holders and short-term visitors who are placed on the Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

Persons placed on SHN (PSHNs) may be contacted via calls or WhatsApp to verify their location. During the audio and/or video call via WhatsApp, PSHNs may be requested to show their immediate surroundings to verify their location. During the call, PSHNs will be asked to provide the last four digits of their Identity Card/ travel document to ascertain their identity.

In addition, PSHNs may receive house visits. All our officers performing house visits will produce their warrant cards or ICA authorisation letter as a form of identification.

Please be informed that ICA will not ask for any financial information. 

If travellers receive a call from us and wish to verify the authenticity of the phone call, they can call the SHN helpline at 6812 5555.

The Government will continue to implement surveillance and enforcement measures to ensure compliance with the SHN, so that the well-being of the community is not put at risk.

Anyone can report a Singapore citizen, permanent resident, Long-Term Visit Pass holder or short-term visitor who did not comply with the SHN to ICA via
- go.gov.sg/reportshnbreach; or
- 6812 5555.

## Penalties for breach of SHN

Those who fail to comply with the Stay-Home Notice requirements can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act and its Regulations, and face a fine up to $10,000, or up to six months’ imprisonment, or both.

In addition, if the person is a:

- **Singapore permanent resident or long-term pass holder** (Long-Term Visit Pass/ Dependant’s Pass/ Student’s Pass), the Re-Entry Permit or passes may be revoked, or the validity shortened and the person may be barred from entering Singapore in future.
- **Short-term visitor**, the visit pass may be cancelled and the person may be barred from entering Singapore.
- **Work pass holder**, the work pass may be revoked.
- **Full-time student** attending a preschool, school or other educational institution in Singapore, the person might be subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or dismissal.
