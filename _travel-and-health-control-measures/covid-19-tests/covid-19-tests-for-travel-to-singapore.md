### COVID-19 Tests for Travel to Singapore

This page provides information on the various COVID-19 tests to be taken when travelling to Singapore.

Where COVID-19 tests are required as part of travel health measures, travellers aged 3 and above in the current calendar year (i.e. those born in 2018 or before) departing for Singapore will also be subjected to COVID-19 tests.

The health measures to be imposed may not be limited to COVID-19 tests, and you should check the requirements of your respective <a href="/arriving/overview">Safe Travel Lane</a> for full details.


#### 1. PCR Test before Departing to Singapore

Depending on the travellers’ travel history and [Safe Travel Lane](/arriving/overview) used to visit Singapore, travellers may be required to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) before departing to Singapore. 

<b>Please check the respective Safe Travel Lane pages for details of the pre-departure PCR test requirements, which may vary (i.e. either 48 or 72 hours before departure) depending on travel history and Safe Travel Lane used.</b>

To test for COVID-19, travellers bound for Singapore are required to take a PCR test at an [internationally accredited or recognised lab/clinic/medical facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing). Travellers should request for a copy of the PCR test result as it will be considered by the airlines and ferry terminal operators as proof that the traveller has been tested for COVID-19. The documentary proof should be in English and should also state the date of the test taken, traveller’s name as well as date of birth or passport number (per the passport used for travelling). Travellers who fail to produce the required documentary proof of a valid negative pre-departure PCR test may be denied boarding or turned away.
