### SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF)

To limit the spread of COVID-19, several hotels in Singapore have been designated as SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF). In general, travellers issued with a 14-day SHN are required to complete their SHN at an SDF. As of 1 Jan 2021, all returning travellers will have to pay for the cost of their SDF stay. The cost is $2,000, inclusive of meals and GST. This does not include the relevant [charges for COVID-19 tests](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price). Travellers who fail to pay for their SDF may be charged interest for late payments.  Please refer to the [FAQs](/health/faq#shnsdf) for more information.

Due to the fast-changing demand for SDF capacity, all arriving travellers will be assigned to an SDF by the Government. Travellers who wish to upgrade to an SDF suite at a specific hotel at additional cost, may click [here](/health/shn/sdfupgrade) to find out more.

Any prior approvals for opt-out granted may be revoked due to the latest public health risk assessment. In such an event, the prevailing border and health control measures will apply. This includes SDF stays and payments, where applicable.
