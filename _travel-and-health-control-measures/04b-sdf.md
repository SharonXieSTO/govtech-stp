### SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF)

To limit the spread of COVID-19, several hotels in Singapore have been designated as SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF). In general, travellers issued with a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will complete their SHN at an SDF. The standard cost of the 14-day SDF stay for a single adult, is S$2,000, inclusive of meals and GST. The cost excludes the relevant charges for COVID-19 tests. It also excludes laundry, which will require a separate top-up if requested. If there are two adult family members sharing a room (specifically, grandparents, parents, spouse, parents-in-law, siblings or children), the cost of the 14-day SDF stay is S$1,300 per person. Costs will vary for minors depending on their age. The costs will be made known to travellers during the entry approval application process or at check-in to the SDF for Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents. Travellers who fail to pay for the SDF cost may be charged interest for late payments.  Please refer to the [FAQs](/health/faq#shnsdf) for more information.

Travellers with travel history to India in the last 14 days prior to entering Singapore will have to serve 21-day SHN at an SDF. The standard cost of the 21-day SDF stay for a single adult is S$3,000, based on pro-ration of existing rates for a 14-day SDF stay. COsts for minors and shared rooms will be likewise be pro-rated the same way. 

Due to the fast-changing demand for SDF capacity, all arriving travellers will be assigned to an SDF by the Government. Travellers who wish to book an SDF suite at a specific hotel at higher cost, may click [here](/health/shn/sdfupgrade) to find out more.

### SDF Opt-Out

Travellers may opt-out of SDF if they satisfy either of the following conditions. Applications to opt-out of SDF must be submitted three working days before the travellerâ€™s scheduled arrival in Singapore.
