## Stay Home Notice (SHN) and Dedicated SHN Facility

#### 1. Am I required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN)? How long is the SHN?

The duration of your SHN, if required, depends on your 14-day travel history and prescribed condition of your entry into Singapore. For approved travellers, this requirement will be stipulated in the Entry Approval Letter or Safe Travel Pass issued.

Prospective travellers may refer to this [table](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf), or the specific SafeTravel lane (can be accessed from this [page](/arriving/overview)) for information pertaining to SHN.

#### 2. My place of residence is unsuitable for me to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Can I opt to serve my SHN at the SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF) instead?

Singapore citizens and permanent residents whose residence is unsuitable to serve their [SHN](/health/shn), may appeal to serve their SHN at an [SDF](/health/shn/sdf). These appeals, which are subject to approval, can be submitted using this link. 

Non-resident travellers who not required to serve their SHN at an SDF, i.e. those serving 7-day SHN, but wish to do so, may make a direct reservation with the hotel. Before a room booking is made, travellers should check and ensure that the hotel can accommodate guests serving their SHN.

#### 3. I had left for Singapore from a country/region where I have the option of serving my Stay-Home Home (SHN) at my own residence rather than an SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). However, I had transited to Singapore via a second country, which imposes the mandatory 14-day SHN at an SDF. Which SHN measure will apply to me?

The more stringent travel health control measures would apply. This means that a traveller who had transited to Singapore via a second country where mandatory [SDF](/health/shn/sdf) stay is required, will serve their [SHN](/health/shn) at an SDF upon arrival into Singapore.

#### 4. I am presently serving my Stay-Home Notice (SHN). How do I obtain my daily necessities?

SHN are legal notices issued under the Infectious Diseases Act, which directs its recipients to remain in their place of residence or [SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF)](/health/shn/sdf) <u>at all times</u> for a stipulated period. Any breach in SHN requirements is punishable under Singapore’s laws and additional penalties such as the revocation of a Work Pass may also be taken by the relevant authorities.

Travellers should note that basic essentials such as portable water, cleaning supplies as well as daily meals (three times a day based on dietary preference) will be provided by the SDF. Should you require extra food and essentials, you may opt for home delivery services or enlist the help of others. When collecting these items, please refrain from collecting them personally. If you require any financial, emotional or psychological support during the SHN period you may call **6812 5555**.

#### 5. When does the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) generally begin and how would I know if it has ended?

The SHN comes into effect **immediately** on the day of arrival in Singapore and ends after a negative [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) result is conveyed, whichever is later. Travellers may be alerted via, SMS or by the SDF concierge. See illustrations [here](/health/shn) or use this [calculator](/shn-calculator) to determine the end of your SHN.

#### 6. What should I do if I need to attend to an emergency before checking into my Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF)?

As a condition for entry into Singapore, all travellers must commute directly to their SHN accommodation or SDF **immediately** after clearing immigration. The failure to do so constitutes a breach of the SHN requirements which is punishable under Singapore’s laws.

In the event of an emergency, travellers may contact the SHN helpline at **6812 5555** for assistance and advice.

#### 7. Am I permitted to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF) of my choice?

Due to the fast-changing demands for SDFs, travellers will be assigned to an available SDF upon arrival. Travellers who wish to upgrade to an SDF suite at a specific hotel at an additional cost may [click here](/health/shn/sdfupgradefaq) for more information.

#### 8. Due to the circumstances of my travel, e.g. I’m travelling with my extended family, I have some specific room requirements. How do I request for room adjustments?

Travellers may contact the concierge at the Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF) first for help. For requests that the SDF is unable to facilitate, e.g. caregiver support, SDF opt-out, travellers may wish to refer to this page for more details, or submit a request to the corresponding channels, below:

## Transport Arrangements During SHN

#### 1. What are the types of transport that I can take if I am serving my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an SHN-dedicated facility (SDF)?

Upon arrival, travellers will commute directly to their assigned SDF using government-arranged transport. During the SHN period, travellers are prohibited from leaving their accommodations. They are only permitted to leave the SDF if they are due to take their [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) at the designated testing facility. As travel via public transport is prohibited, transport will be arranged by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to ferry travellers to and from the designated testing facility.

Travellers should only leave their SDF for their PCR test appointment only if they are feeling well. Travellers who are unwell should remain in their accommodation and alert the relevant agencies listed in this [page](https://go.gov.sg/tc) immediately.

#### 2. What are the types of transport that I can take if I am serving my 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at my place of residence?

Travellers who are serving their [SHN](/health/shn/sdf) at their own residence are only permitted to arrange for transport with the following transport operators. During the SHN period, travellers are prohibited from leaving their place of residence unless they are due to take a [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) at a designated testing facility. Travellers may arrange for transport with the same transport operators below if they are commuting to the testing facility for their PCR test. When arranging for transport with the transport operator, travellers must identify themselves as persons serving SHN.

#### 3. What are the types of transport that I can take if I am serving a 7-day Stay-Home Notice?

Travellers may use their own private vehicle or hire a taxi/private hire car with the designated operators (see table below). The use of cabs hailed from the street is prohibited.

When securing a transport booking, travellers must inform the transport operator as well as driver that they are served with a [Stay-Home Notice (SHN)](/health/shn/sdf). Travellers that opt to arrange for transport using a mobile application may key “SHN” in the chat/note/comment box or by checking the SHN checkbox (if provided within the app).

## COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”)

#### 1. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. Do I need to be tested for COVID-19 before travelling? What test should I take and how long before my departure should I be tested?

Travellers approved for entry into Singapore will be informed via a condition stipulated in the Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass on whether they need to be tested for COVID-19 before arrival. Alternatively, travellers who are planning to visit Singapore may refer to this [table](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) or the [specific safe travel lanes](/arriving/overview) to check if he/she needs to be tested before arrival.

To test for COVID-19, travellers bound for Singapore are required to take a [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) at an [internationally accredited or recognised lab/clinic/medical facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing). Travellers should ask for a copy of their PCR test result as it will be considered by the airline and immigration officer as proof that the traveller has been tested for COVID-19. The documentary proof should be in English and should also state the date of the test taken, traveller’s name as well as their Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used for travelling). Travellers who fail to produce the required documentary proof of having taken the PCR test within the stipulated time before arrival in Singapore may be denied boarding or turned away.

In general, travellers who are required to take a PCR test must do so <u>within 72 hours before departure to Singapore</u>. This applies to travellers on direct flights, or on connecting flights where the transit duration does not exceed 24 hours. Travellers on connecting flights with a transit duration exceeding 24 hours, may take a PCR test within 72 hours at the last transit location.


#### 2. I am [transiting via Singapore](https://www.caas.gov.sg/covid-19-updates/updates/Publication/travellers-to-be-allowed-to-transit-through-changi-airport-from-2-june-2020). Do I still need to have a valid negative COVID-19 test result?

Only travellers transiting in Singapore from India / Indonesia / Philippines are required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result.

Due to the fast-evolving epidemiological situation, travellers should confirm with the airline on their transit details/requirements.

#### 3. What will happen if I arrive in Singapore and do not have a valid negative PCR test certificate?

As a condition to enter Singapore, travellers may be required to produce a negative [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) result. This may be enforced by the airline during pre-boarding checks. Unless there are other compelling reasons, travellers failing to meet this condition will be denied entry into Singapore.

Travellers that present a falsified COVID-19 test certificates will be dealt with accordingly, and this antecedent will be taken into consideration for their future applications for entry into or stay in Singapore.

#### 4. I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. When can I travel into Singapore?

Travellers who are unwell or recently diagnosed with [COVID-19](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs) should defer their travels. 

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, airlines will deny travellers from boarding an aircraft if they have a recent diagnosis of COVID-19, i.e. first diagnosis made 21 days or fewer from date of travel. Travellers should only schedule their trip to Singapore 21 days after the first diagnosis and after they have fully recovered from COVID-19. 

#### 5. I have recovered from COVID-19. Am I required to be tested for COVID-19 before entry into Singapore?

If a [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) is required to be taken 72 hours before departure, i.e. a condition for entry into Singapore, travellers must take the test regardless of whether they have recovered from COVID-19. 

In addition to producing the COVID-19 PCR test result, which may show a positive test result due to prolonged shedding of the virus post-recovery, the traveller should also produce documentary proof of their first COVID-19 diagnosis based on a PCR test result. Travellers who are diagnosed with COVID-19 infection 21 days or less, from the date of travel, will be denied boarding by their airline or ferry. Recovered travellers who are cleared for entry into Singapore may be subject to an additional [serology test](/health/covid19-tests/serology) on arrival to confirm their recovered status.

#### 6. How will I know my COVID-19 test result?

Hardcopy/softcopy of the COVID-19 test result will not be issued. Travellers who are Work Pass Holders (and their dependants) will receive their results via SMS or email. All other travellers will be informed of their swab test results verbally by phone or in person. 

Travellers with a SingPass account may login to [HealthHub](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices) to view their swab test results once available.

#### 7. Can I refuse the COVID-19 test?

As a condition for entry into Singapore, travellers may be required to take a [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) and/or [serology test](/health/covid19-tests/serology) while in the country. These conditions would be made explicit during application and reiterated to the traveller again, by way of a condition stipulated in their Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass. 

Action will be taken against errant travellers who fail to comply with any of the stipulated requirement/condition for entry into Singapore. This may amount to a fine and/or imprisonment term as prescribed in the Infectious Diseases Act. Additional penalties such as the revocation of a Work Pass may also apply.

#### 8. Do I have to complete my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) if I have been tested negative for COVID-19 before departing to Singapore?

Yes, travellers must complete their SHN even after they are tested negative for their [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) before departing to Singapore. You may refer to the illustrations [here](/health/shn) on the general duration of your SHN.

#### 9. I am travelling with my child. Is my child be required to be tested for COVID-19 before entry into Singapore? Are infants exempted?

Travellers arriving from countries that require a [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) must do so if they are above seven years of age in that calendar year, i.e. born in and before 2015. Travellers whose children are below seven years old in that calendar year, i.e. born after 2015, are exempted.

#### 10. Why do children need to take the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)?

Regardless of age, infected individuals can transmit [COVID-19](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/faqs) to other members of the community if undetected. As part of border health control measures to detect cases early and minimise the public health risk of community transmission,. COVID-19 testing is extended to inbound travellers aged 7 and above (in that calendar year). 

#### 11. My child is very sensitive/has frequent nosebleeds. Can he/she be excused from the SHN+ exit swab?

In Singapore’s context, the [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) is carried out by trained personnel in adherence with the prevailing safety protocols/procedures. Should your child be assessed to have medical contraindications and is unsuitable for the PCR test, alternative arrangements may be made.

#### 12. I am unwell. Can I postpone my COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) appointment?

Travellers who are due to take their PCR test but are feeling unwell should remain in their [Stay-Home Notice (SHN)](/health/shn) accommodation, e.g. own residence or [SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF)](/health/shn/sdf), and alert the relevant agencies listed in this [page](https://go.gov.sg/tc).

## Pre-Departure Tests for Travellers Departing from Singapore

#### 1. Do clinics need to help travellers digitally authenticate and endorse their HealthCerts?

No, the traveller should digitally authenticate and endorse their HealthCerts themselves at <https://www.notarise.gov.sg>. When issuing the HealthCerts to them, clinics, labs and/or the tech provider should also highlight the requirement to the traveller. In the event that the tech providers are already performing digital authentication and endorsement via Application Programming Interfaces (API), travellers will receive an endorsed document without having to transact on the Notαrise portal.

#### 2. The PRC embassy stipulates both PCR and serology IgM tests for all travellers entering China. Since the HealthCert is currently only for PCR tests, how will travellers meet the entry requirements?

The combined PCR and IgM HealthCert will be available soon. In the meantime, travellers should highlight to the clinic if their PDT is for the purposes of entry to China, in which case they should be issued with an additional paper certificate in accordance with the PRC embassy’s requirements. [This page](/health/covid19-tests/pre-departure-test) will be updated accordingly when the combined schema is available.

#### 3. The country/region I am travelling to requires a test other than a PCR test. Since the HealthCert is currently only for PCR tests, how will travellers show their test results to the relevant authorities?

In such a case, the traveller may request for a hardcopy test result from the doctor to show to the airlines and immigration authorities of the arrival country/region.

#### 4. How will travellers receive their Pre-Departure Test (PDT) certificate?

The test results will be sent to the traveller by either the clinic where the PDT was taken, or by their partnering clinical laboratory. This will be in the form of a digital certificate in accordance with the HealthCerts schema and standards. In the event the traveller does not have the ability to show the digital certificate on arrival at the destination country/region, the traveller may request for a hardcopy from the doctor.
#### 5. Can travellers still use digital certificates without a SingPass account (e.g. foreign citizen who is a short-stay traveller)?

Travellers may still digitally authenticate and endorse their test certificate on www.notarise.gov.sg without signing in to SingPass. However, please note that the traveller will only be receive the endorsed HealthCert via email, with no additional copy stored in the SingPass mobile app.

#### 6. What if the digitally authenticated and endorsed certificate was not sent to the traveller?

Please check the email spam folder. If the email is still not there, please contact <notarise_support@tech.gov.sg>. 

#### 7. Can a third party transact on behalf of a traveller who requires the assistance to digitally authenticate and endorse their PDT certificate?

Yes, a third party may do so if they have the digital certificate of the traveller(s) that they will be transacting on behalf of.

#### 8. Where can GP clinics find out more about digital certificate capabilities and providing PDTs?

Clinics may refer to the following circulars on the MOH website: [Mandating Digital Health Certificates for COVID-19 Pre-Departure Testing](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/mandating-digital-health-certificates-for-covid-19-predeparture-testing), and [Extension of Deadline for Digital Health Certificates for COVID-19 Pre-Departure Testing](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/extension-of-deadline-for-digital-health-certificates-for-covid19-pre-departure-testing)

## **Travel Insurance with COVID-19 Coverage** 

#### 1.	Do all travellers entering Singapore require mandatory insurance coverage?

The requirement will apply to short-term visitors who are entering Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs). It will not apply to returning Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents (SCs/PRs), as they are able to tap on regular healthcare financing arrangements for their inpatient medical bills should they develop onset of COVID-19 symptoms within 14 days of their return.

#### 2.	How can travellers purchase the insurance coverage?

The SafeTravel website provides a list of products offered by Singapore-based insurers (see below). Travellers can visit the respective insurers’ websites to purchase the inbound insurance plan. Travellers may also purchase overseas products which cover their visit to Singapore.

#### 3.	Do travellers need to show proof of travel insurance purchase when they apply for the ATP or RGL? What documents do they need to submit to show that they are insured?

With effect from 1 February 2021, 0000 hrs (Singapore time), visitors who apply to enter Singapore under the ATP and RGLs will have to declare, at the point of ATP application, that they will purchase travel insurance with minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs prior to travel to Singapore. They are required to bring along an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy before departing for Singapore.

#### 4.	Must the insurance be bought prior to their travel to Singapore? Can travellers purchase it upon arrival in Singapore?

Yes, the insurance must  be bought prior to their travel to Singapore. 

#### 5.	Are foreign travellers entitled to use public hospitals?

Foreign travellers who test positive for COVID-19  receive care in private hospitals.

#### 6.	What does the S$30,000 requirement cover?

The S$30,000 minimum insurance requirement refers to coverage for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs. 

#### 7.	What is the basis of setting the minimum insurance coverage requirement at S$30,000?

The requirement is based on COVID-19 bill sizes at private hospitals. 

#### 8.	How much are the typical hospital bills?

The cost of COVID-19 treatment varies depending on the patient’s clinical condition. The insurance coverage was sized to cover the majority of COVID-19 hospital bills in private hospitals.

#### 9.	How much are the premiums? 

The premiums would depend on factors such as the country/region from which the traveller is departing from, the length of the trip and/or factors such as the travellers’ age. More details can be found on the respective insurers’ websites. 

#### 10.	Will this requirement cover all short-term visitors? How about short-term visitors from the other travel lanes? 

The Government will review whether to extend the requirement to short-term visitors from other countries, taking into consideration the availability of products in the insurance market.

#### 11.	Do recovered COVID-19 visitors need to buy insurance? How about vaccinated travellers? 

Yes, both recovered and vaccinated foreign travellers need to buy insurance before travel to Singapore. There is still a risk that these travellers can get the COVID-19 infection, and require medical attention or hospitalisation for evaluation.

#### 12.	Should the COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond $30,000, who will pay the excess? 

As per existing practice, travellers will have to pay for their own treatment costs beyond insurance coverage. 

Visitors and/or hosts will be required to declare, at the point of application, that they have purchased or will be purchasing travel insurance that meets MOH’s minimum coverage requirements for the duration of their stay in Singapore, and will pay for any treatment costs beyond the insurance coverage, before being given approval to travel to Singapore.

#### 13.	Would Long Term Pass Holders be required to buy insurance? 

With effect from 1 Jan 2021, all Work Permit and S Pass holders entering Singapore must be covered by insurance for COVID-19 treatment if the pass holder develops COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival into Singapore. 

All other Long-Term Pass holders, (i.e., Employment Pass holders, Dependant’s Pass Holders, Student’s Pass Holders and Long-Term Visit Pass Holders), are encouraged to purchase insurance as the Government will no longer bear the costs of COVID-19 treatment if they develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival into Singapore.

#### 3. How do I request a refund for my COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test’) as well as stay at the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) dedicated facility (SDF)?

All forfeited pre-payments will go toward covering the relevant costs have been incurred to secure and prepare the accommodation for the traveller.
 
Requests for refunds will only be considered if there are strong mitigating factors.
