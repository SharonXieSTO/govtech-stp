### Overview 

The SHN is a legal notice issued under the Infectious Diseases Act that requires newly arrived travellers to remain in their place of residence or Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility ([SDF](/health/shn/sdf)) for a stipulated period, as part of Singapore’s pandemic management strategy. The failure to comply with any SHN requirement is punishable under Singapore laws and can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional penalties such as the cancellation of long-term visit passes could also be taken against errant individuals by the relevant authorities.

The requirements for SHN and COVID-19 tests are specific to individual [Safe Travel Lanes](/arriving/overview). Travellers approved for entry into Singapore should refer to their Entry Approval Letter or SafeTravel Pass for details on whether they are required to serve their SHN and COVID-19 test to take. In general, travellers issued with a 7 or 14-day SHN will take a mandatory [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest)(“PCR test”) towards the end of their SHN. Travellers that had been in the United Kingdom or South Africa in the past 14 days prior to arriving in Singapore will serve a 14-day SHN at an SDF, and a further 7-day SHN at their place of residence; a COVID-19 PCR test will be conducted at the end of each SHN.

Please use the <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/shn-calculator">SHN End Date Calculator</a> for an estimate of when your SHN will end. Travellers should note that the SHN comes into effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

### SHN Compliance Checks

Travellers issued with the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be subjected to on-site or electronic compliance checks (SMS, phone/video calls) from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Education (MOE). Travellers should note that officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identity. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked to provide the last four digits of his/her Identity Card or Travel Document for verification. Any payment request made by the caller may be a scam. Travellers with SHN issues may call the SafeTravel Helpline at 6812 5555 for further enquiries or assistance.

Travellers serving their SHN outside of SDFs will also be issued with electronic SHN monitoring devices and more information on these devices can be found [here](/health/shn-monitoring).
