### Overview 

SHNs are legal notices issued under Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act, to require a person to remain at their place of residence or Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility ([SDF](/health/shn/sdf)) at all times for a stipulated period. Any breach in the SHN requirements is punishable under Singapore laws, which can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional punitive measures such as the cancellation of long-term visit passes could also be taken by the relevant authorities.

Requirements for SHN or COVID-19 PCR tests are specific to individual [Safe Travel Lanes](/arriving/overview). Depending on the travellers’ travel history and safe travel lane used to enter Singapore, travellers may be issued with a 7 or 14-day SHN with a mandatory [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) conducted towards the end of the SHN. Travellers with recent travel history in the past 14 days to UK and South Africa will need to serve a 14-day SHN at an SDF, and subsequently a further 7-day SHN at their place of residence; a COVID-19 PCR test will be conducted at the end of each SHN.

Examples of how to calculate the end of each SHN duration can be found below. Travellers should note that the SHN comes into effect <u>immediately</u> on the day of its issuance.

<sup>*</sup>For travellers serving SHN in an SDF, the SDF will inform the traveller of the check-out time once it receives confirmation of the negative COVID-19 test result from the relevant government agencies. The traveller will only be allowed to leave the SDF thereafter.

Read the Health Advisory for Persons issued SHN [here](/files/MOH-Health-Advisory-SHN.pdf), and watch the video below that explains the SHN Requirements.

### SHN Compliance Checks

Travellers issued with the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be subjected to on-site or electronic compliance checks (SMS, phone/video calls) from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Education (MOE). Travellers should note that officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identity. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked to provide the last four digits of his/her Identity Card or Travel Document for verification. <u>Any payment request made by the caller may be a scam.</u> Travellers may call 6812 5555 for further enquiries or assistance.

Travellers serving their SHN outside of SDFs will also be issued with electronic SHN monitoring devices and more information on these devices can be found [here](/health/shn-monitoring).
