### Overview 

SHNs are legal notices issued under Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act, to require a person to remain at their place of residence or Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility ([SDF](#sdf)) at all times for a stipulated period. Any breach in the SHN requirements is punishable under Singapore laws, which can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional punitive measures such as the cancellation of the work pass could also be taken by the relevant authorities.

Depending on the travellers’ travel history and safe travel lane used to enter Singapore, travellers may be issued with a 7 or 14-day SHN with a mandatory [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test](/health/covid19-tests) conducted towards the end of the SHN.

Requirements for SHN or COVID-19 PCR tests are specific to individual [Safe Travel Lanes](/arriving/overview). Travellers should note that the SHN comes into effect immediately on the day of its issuance. The SHN will end at 12 pm, 7 or 14 days after arrival. See examples below:

### SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF)

To limit the spread of COVID-19, several hotels in Singapore have been designated as SHN-Dedicated Facilities (SDF). In general, travellers issued with a 14-day SHN are required to complete their SHN at an SDF. Eligible travellers must apply three working days before their scheduled arrival in Singapore, to opt-out of SDF if they meet the following conditions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">Conditions</th>
      <th style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">Application Form</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td  style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">Suffer from critical illness, special medical condition, or have mobility issues
</td>
      <td style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;"><a href="https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds">Here</a></td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
      <td style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">Are using Safe Travel Lanes from countries/regions eligible for SDF opt-out (refer to table <a href="/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf">here</a>), where they have remained for the past 14 days before departure, and will serve their SHN at their own residence:
          <ol style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
            <li style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:20px;"> Alone, i.e. no domestic helper(s); or </li>
<li style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:20px;"> With household members that share the same travel history and are also serving their SHN for the same duration and period.</li>
        </ol>
           </td>
      <td style="font-size:20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px;">Application form <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/sc-pr/opt-out/apply-now">here</a> For Singaporean Citizens and PRs <br/><br/> Foreign Travellers can opt out during their entry application process 
</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  
Any prior approvals for opt-out granted may be revoked due to the latest public health risk assessment. In such an event, the prevailing border and health control measures will apply. This includes SDF stays and payments, where applicable. As of 30 December 2020, the cost of SDF stay, inclusive of GST, is about $2,000, not including [charges for COVID-19 tests](/health/covid19-tests/#price). The actual amount, however, will be conveyed and charged to the traveller during check-in. Travellers who fail to pay for their SDF can expect to be charged for late payments. 

### SHN Compliance Checks

Travellers issued with the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be subjected to on-site or electronic compliance checks (SMS, phone/video calls) from the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Ministry of Education (MOE). Travellers should note that officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identity. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked to provide the last four digits of his/her Identity Card or Travel Document for verification. <u>Any payment request made by the caller may be a scam</u>. Travellers may call 6812 5555 for further enquiries or assistance.

Travellers serving their SHN outside of SDFs will also be issued with electronic SHN monitoring devices and more information on these devices can be found [here](/health/shn-monitoring).
