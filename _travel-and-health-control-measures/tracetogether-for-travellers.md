TraceTogether is a technological solution to combat the spread of COVID-19 via contact tracing. All travellers will be required to utilise the TraceTogether app, or rent a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.
Children aged 6 years or younger in the current calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.
1.	Installing TraceTogether App or Obtaining TraceTogether Token

A)	TraceTogether App 

Prior to arriving in Singapore, travellers should check that their mobile devices are compatible with the TraceTogether app, download it on their mobile devices, and register their mobile number and profile on the app. Travellers must register their profile on the app with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that they are using to enter Singapore. A TraceTogether (TT) App setup guide for travellers can be found here. 
Visitors must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on their TraceTogether app holding screen immediately after they have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore and follow the instructions to activate the app.
B)	TraceTogether Token

Only children who are aged 7 to 12 years in the current calendar year, and those unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability or special need, are eligible to be issued TraceTogether tokens with payment of a S$50 deposit (in lieu of the requirement to have a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded).
