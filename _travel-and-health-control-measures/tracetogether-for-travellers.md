TraceTogether is a technological solution to combat the spread of COVID-19 via contact tracing. All travellers will be required to utilise the TraceTogether app, or rent a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.

<u>Children aged 6 years or younger in the current calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.</u>

### 1.	Installing TraceTogether App or Obtaining TraceTogether Token

#### A)	TraceTogether App 

Prior to arriving in Singapore, travellers should check that their mobile devices are compatible with the TraceTogether app, download it on their mobile devices, and register their mobile number and profile on the app. Travellers must register their profile on the app with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that they are using to enter Singapore. A TraceTogether (TT) App setup guide for travellers can be found [here](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/1500002071841-I-m-travelling-to-Singapore-How-do-I-set-up-the-TraceTogether-App-). 

For visitors arriving via Changi Airport and are unable to download the TraceTogether App on their mobile devices, but do not fall into the groups eligible for TraceTogether tokens issuance in section B below, they are required to rent a mobile device from Changi Recommends.

Visitors must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on their TraceTogether app holding screen immediately after they have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore and follow the instructions to activate the app.

#### B)	TraceTogether Token

Depending on the traveller’s mode of entry, the eligible groups for TraceTogether tokens issuance, payment modes for the tokens, collection and return of the tokens differ:

### 2.	Using TraceTogether

#### A)	TraceTogether App Users

To facilitate contact tracing, travellers must keep the TraceTogether app activated on their mobile devices while in Singapore. Visitors are also required to retain the TraceTogether app with the data for 21 consecutive days after leaving Singapore. A traveller must upload all data in the TraceTogether app upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health should he/she test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or in the first 21 days after leaving Singapore.

#### B)	TraceTogether Token Users

To facilitate contact tracing, visitors are required to carry their own tokens with them wherever they go, and not exchange their tokens with others. Each token is uniquely tagged to the individual that registered for it.

Just before departing Singapore, visitors must return their own TraceTogether tokens in-person at any of the following places: Changi Recommends booths at the Changi Airport Departure Hall, Seletar Business Aviation Centre at Seletar Airport, Woodlands Checkpoint, Tuas Checkpoint or Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, prior to their departure from Singapore. Details on where the tokens return booths/counters can be found [here](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/900007674823-Do-Short-Term-Visitors-need-to-return-their-TraceTogether-TT-Tokens-before-leaving-Singapore-).

The S$50 deposit will be refunded if:
- the TraceTogether token the visitor is returning belongs to him/her; and
-	the visitor had made a deposit for the TraceTogether token being returned; and
-	the visitor is returning the token in-person.

The returned TraceTogether tokens will be securely stored for 21 days from the day of collection, and the data in the tokens will be uploaded upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health, should the visitor test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or in the first 21 days after leaving Singapore.
