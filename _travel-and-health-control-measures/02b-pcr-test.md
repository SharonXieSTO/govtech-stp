### COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”)

The COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) is regarded worldwide to as the most accurate and reliable test to detect active COVID-19 infections. A PCR test is generally administered by a trained professional who will take a swab sample from the nose and/or throat of a traveller. In Singapore’s context, <u>all</u> inbound travellers aged 7 and above, including those who had recovered from COVID-19, will be PCR-tested before and/or upon arrival.

#### PCR Test before Departing to Singapore

Depending on the travellers’ travel history and Safe Travel lane used to visit Singapore, travellers may be required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before departing to Singapore.
