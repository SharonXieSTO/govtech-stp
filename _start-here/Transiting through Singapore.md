<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Transit travellers refer to those who depart for a third country via Singapore <u>without clearing arrival immigration</u>.</b> Travellers who intend to clear arrival immigration and enter Singapore, before departing for a third country, are not considered as transit travellers. They are responsible for ensuring that they fulfill all requirements for entry into Singapore, and should refer to the “<a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore</a>” page for more information.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Singapore does not require COVID-19 tests, travel visas or entry approvals for transit travellers.</b> However, travellers who transit in Changi must have  their checked-in luggage tagged-through from the origin airport to their final destination. Travellers interested in connecting through Changi Airport should consult their airline on the options available.</p>
