### 1. Eligibility

<p style="font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers are advised to check with their airline if it has an approved transfer route through Singapore before purchasing tickets. <b>Travellers do not need to obtain approvals under any Safe Travel Lane (e.g. Vaccinated Travel Lane) to transit in Singapore.</b></p>

### 2. COVID-19 Pre-Departure Test

<b>If the traveller's final destination country/region has a pre-departure test requirement, travellers are advised to take their pre-departure tests at the originating country as such testing services are not available during transit in Singapore.</b>

Otherwise, transit travellers with a layover at Changi Airport of less than 24 hours do not have to take or present proof of havng taken a pre-departure test.

### 3. Entry Visas
