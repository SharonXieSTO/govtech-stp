### COVID-19 Pre-Departure Test (if required by destination country/region)

Travellers are advised to check with the authorities of their destination country/region on whether they are required to take a COVID-19 test before departure. Travellers who are required to take a COVID-19 test in Singapore before their departure can make an appointment at any of the clinics offering PCR Pre-Departure Tests, listed [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers). 

Travellers are responsible for ensuring that the test conducted by the clinic meets the testing requirements of the destination country/region. Travellers should also allocate adequate time to take and receive their test result before departure from Singapore. In general, travellers who present themselves at the clinic less than 38 hours before the scheduled flight may not receive their test results on time.

Any cost incurred for travel-related tests will be borne by the traveller, which the traveller can enquire with the clinic before making an appointment. Government subsidies will not be given for these tests.

To make an appointment, travellers should have the following information ready:
- Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders only and passport (for all travellers)
- Departure flight timing (if applicable)
- Possible times for your test slot
- Address in Singapore
- Contact number
- Email address to receive the result memo

On the day of the PCR test appointment, travellers will be asked to present the following: 
- Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders only and passport (for all travellers)

### Digital PDT and Vaccination Certificates for Overseas use

##### Digital PDT Certificate

MOH has mandated that all Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Pre-Departure Test (PDT) results issued by clinics be issued in the form of a digital certificate compliant with the HealthCerts schema and standards. 

**All outbound travellers taking their PCR PDTs in Singapore will receive a digital results certificate, and are required to digitally authenticate and endorse the digital test certificate via <https://www.notarise.gov.sg> before travel.** This ensures that the result and certificate is issued and authenticated by MOH (i.e. it is issued by an approved clinic/lab and has not been tampered with).

After using <https://www.notarise.gov.sg>, the QR code of your digitally authenticated and endorsed test certificate will be e-mailed to you within 15 minutes. If you have presented your NRIC at the clinic, the QR code will also be automatically uploaded onto your SingPass mobile app. The QR code can be shown to foreign immigration and customs authorities, who may scan the QR code with any reader (e.g. normal phone camera) to verify the authenticity of the digital certificate. 

##### Digital Vaccination Certificate

Hardcopy vaccination cards/slips issued to individuals vaccinated in Singapore are <b>not</b> meant for overseas use.

Travellers who wish or need to present proof of their vaccination status to an foreign authority, may request for a digital vaccination certificate from [Notαrise](https://www.notarise.gov.sg). For successful requests, a digital vaccination certificate will be sent to the traveller’s email and/or Singpass application. Travellers should note that the use of the digital vaccination certificate is subject to the prevailing entry requirements of the destination country.
