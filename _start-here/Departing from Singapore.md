### 1) Departure Advisories and Requirements

<ol style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px;"><b>Travel advisories</b> - Singapore residents who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated are advised to defer all travel except in exceptional circumstances. For fully vaccinated residents, travel to high-risk countries/regions including Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe is discouraged. All departing travellers should review the latest <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory/#travel_advisory" target="_blank">Ministry of Health travel advisory</a> and <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.sg/where-are-you-travelling-to" target="_blank">specific destination advisories from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</a> </li>
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px;"><b>Requirements for departing from Singapore</b> – Travellers do not need specific approval to leave Singapore. However, all travellers including Vaccinated Travel Lane (Air/Land) users should check with the authorities of the destination country/region on the requirements imposed on travellers departing from Singapore, including whether a pre-departure test and digital health and vaccine certificates are required. Travellers may also utilise <a href="/rgl/visiting-rgl-counterparts" target="_blank">Reciprocal Green Lane</a> outbound arrangements to travel to Mainland China and Brunei. </li>
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px;"><b>Requirements for returning to Singapore</b> - Travellers who intend to return to Singapore should note that the prevailing entry requirements will apply for their return to Singapore. For more details on entry requirements and SafeTravel Lanes available, refer to the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page. Travellers who are required to obtain entry approval before returning to Singapore (e.g. long term pass holders, work pass holders, student pass holders) are advised to secure an entry date before leaving Singapore, if they require certainty of a return date.</li>
</ol>

### 2) Obtaining a Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test in Singapore for Overseas Travel 

Travellers who are required by their destination country/region to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test must <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers" target="_blank">book an appointment with any clinic found on this list</a>. As a general guide, travellers who present themselves at a clinic less than 38 hours before their flight will not receive their pre-departure test result on time. Travellers are therefore strongly encouraged to allocate sufficient lead time when scheduling a test appointment.

On the day of the test, travellers should bring the following documents to the clinic:
- Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders) 
- Passport
- Flight booking details showing the departure timing

For details related to the cost and administration of the test, travellers should enquire directly with the clinic. Travellers should note that government subsidies cannot be used to offset the cost of the test, and a test memo will not be issued for any government-paid-for tests.

### 3) Digitally Authenticated Outbound Pre-departure COVID-19 Test Result

Travellers who have taken a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) in Singapore for overseas travel will receive a digital test result certificate. Those who are unable to receive a digital certificate or have taken a COVID-19 test that is not a PCR test can request a hardcopy certificate from the clinic instead.

Travellers should digitally authenticate their test results with the help of the clinic (if the service is available), and/or via <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a>. All successfully authenticated digital result certificates will be converted into a QR code which can be used during boarding and immigration clearance overseas. Travellers who are authenticating their certificates with the help of the clinic must provide their NRIC. Upon successful authentication, they can retrieve the QR code of their authenticated certificate from their Singpass account. Travellers who have successfully authenticated their certificates with Notαrise can expect to receive their QR code via email within 15 minutes of submission.

Travellers who do not receive their QR code or encounter any technical difficulties while authenticating their digital result certificate may write to <a href="mailto:support@notarise.gov.sg">support@notarise.gov.sg</a> for assistance, or refer to <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/faq" target="_blank">this FAQ</a>.

### 4) Digitally Authenticated Vaccination Certificate

All hardcopy vaccination cards/ slips issued in Singapore, as well as vaccination records found on mobile applications such as <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/" target="_blank">HealthHub</a> are <b>not</b> meant for overseas use. Travellers who are vaccinated in Singapore and are required by  foreign authorities to show digitally authenticated proof of vaccination, should digitally authenticate their vaccination records using <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a>. Upon authentication, a digital vaccination certificate and QR code will be sent by Notαrise to the traveller’s email and/or Singpass mobile application.
