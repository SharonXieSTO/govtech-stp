<div style="border-bottom: 2px solid #E0E0E0; border-left:2px solid #E0E0E0;border-right:2px solid #E0E0E0; background-color:#edf4fa;" class="content">
<p style="font-size:18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">A pre-departure COVID-19 test can be booked with an clinic found on <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers" target="_blank">this list</a>. Before booking, check with the clinic on the type of test administered, cost and estimated turnaround time for the release of the report.
</p>
 <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">On the day of the test, travellers should bring the following documents for registration to facilitate report preparation:</p>
  <ol style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:disc;">
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders)</li>

 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Flight booking details showing the departure timing</li>
</ol>
  <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For PCR tests, the clinic will send you a digitally authenticated test result via email in the form of a QR code, which can be used for boarding and immigration clearance. For ART results, seek the help of the clinic to issue a digitally authenticated report.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Not all travel destinations accept hardcopy vaccination cards/slips issued in Singapore, or vaccination records found in the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg" target="_blank">HealthHub</a> mobile application.
</p>
 <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Apply for a digitally authenticated vaccination certificate using <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg" target="_blank">Notarise</a>, if you are vaccinated in Singapore and required to present such a certificate for entry into the destination country. Upon authentication, Notarise will send a Vaccination HealthCert (i.e. QR code) to your email and/pr SingPass app (for users who logged in using SingPass app/credentials). The QR code can be presented to the relevant foreign authority for scanning as proof of your vaccination status.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For further details on the use of Vaccination HealthCerts, visit <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg" target="_blank">Notarise</a> or write to <a href="mailto:support@notarise.gov.sg" target="_blank">support@notarise.gov.sg</a></p>

### 3) Digitally Authenticated Outbound Pre-departure COVID-19 Test Result

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who have taken a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) or Antigen Rapid Test ("ART") in Singapore for overseas travel will receive a digital test result certificate. Those who are unable to receive a digital certificate or have taken a COVID-19 test that is not a PCR test can request a hardcopy certificate from the clinic instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For PCR tests, travellers will receive a digitally authenticated and endorsed test result via email with the help of the clinic. No further action is required on the traveller's part to get the result digitally endorsed. You may use the QR code within the digital certificate to support checks during boarding and immigration clearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Should you require a digitally endorsed ART result for travel, check with the clinic administering the test whether they are able to support the issuance.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">https://www.notarise.gov.sg/</a>.</p>

### 4) Digitally Authenticated Vaccination Certificate

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">All hardcopy vaccination cards/ slips issued in Singapore, as well as vaccination records found on mobile applications such as <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/" target="_blank">HealthHub</a> may not be accepted for use overseas where digital verification might be required i.e. scanning the QR codes on your digital vaccination certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who are vaccinated in Singapore and are required by foreign authorities to show digitally verifiable proof of vaccination should obtain a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate (‘Vaccination HealthCert’) at <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a>. Upon successful application, the Vaccination HealthCert will be sent by Notαrise to the traveller’s email and/or Singpass app (for users who logged in using Singpass app/ credentials). Foreign authorities will be able to scan the QR codes on the certificate to digitally verify that the certificate is authentic.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Please note that while Singapore's Pre-Departure Test (PDT) and Vaccination HealthCerts are considered equivalent to the EU Digital Covid Certificate (DCC), your destination may be using reader applications that are unable to validate offline QR codes. You can ask the authorities/businesses if verification can also be done by scanning the online QR code with a mobile device connected to the internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">From 1 February 2022, EU DCCs for vaccination may be recognised up to 270 days* after an individual’s completion of the primary vaccination series (i.e. after the 2nd shot for two dose vaccination). As a traveller, you may need to obtain a booster vaccination for travel based on these guidelines, and get your Vaccination HealthCert reissued on the Notαrise portal if required. Do always check the requirements of your destination country first prior to travel.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:16px; line-height:1.35;">*<i>This is based on the European Commissions’ recommendation for travel to Europe. The rules of EU member states may vary, and you are recommended to perform checks on the requirements of your destination country prior to travel.</i></p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who have an expiring Foreign Identification Number (FIN) are advised to get their Vaccination HealthCert early or can read more <a href="https://faq.notarise.gov.sg/hc/en-gb/articles/4573705170713-Who-can-obtain-a-Vaccination-HealthCert-" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
