### 1) Departure Advisories and Requirements

<ol style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Check requirements imposed by foreign authorities</b> - Travellers must check with the authorities of the destination country/region on what requirements they impose on travellers departing from Singapore, including whether COVID-19 tests are required and what vaccines are accepted. <b>Travellers are encouraged to refer to the <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.sg/where-are-you-travelling-to" target="_blank">Ministry of Foreign Affairs' travel guides</a>, which include the appropriate foreign authorities' websites/contacts, sorted by destination.</b> Specific to China and Brunei, travellers may also consider utilising <a href="/rgl/visiting-rgl-counterparts" target="_blank">Reciprocal Green Lane</a> outbound arrangements.</li>
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Requirements for returning to Singapore</b> - Travellers including Singapore residents who intend to return to Singapore should note that the prevailing entry requirements will apply for their return to Singapore. For more details on entry requirements, refer to the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page. Travellers who are required to obtain entry approval before returning to Singapore are advised to secure an entry date before leaving Singapore, if they require certainty of a return date.</li>
</ol>

### 2) Obtaining a Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test or Proof of Infection/Recovery in Singapore for Overseas Travel 

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who are required by their destination country/region to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test must <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers" target="_blank">book an appointment with any clinic found on this list that provides such services</a>. Travellers should check with the clinics on the expected turnaround time for their test report and allocate sufficient lead time when scheduling a test appointment.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">On the day of the test, travellers should bring the following documents to the clinic:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:disc;">
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders)</li> 
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Passport</li>
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Flight booking details showing the departure timing</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For details related to the cost and administration of the test, travellers should enquire directly with the clinic. Travellers should note that government subsidies cannot be used to offset the cost of the test, and a test memo will not be issued for any government-paid-for tests.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who tested positive on a self-administered ART, and need documented proof of first infection/recovery can also visit any <a href="https://go.gov.sg/community-ART-test" target="_blank">Combined Test Centre/Quick Test Centre</a> to undergo a supervised ART and have their results documented.</p>

### 3) Digitally Authenticated Outbound Pre-departure COVID-19 Test Result

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who have taken a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) or Antigen Rapid Test ("ART") in Singapore for overseas travel will receive a digital test result certificate. Those who are unable to receive a digital certificate or have taken a COVID-19 test that is not a PCR test can request a hardcopy certificate from the clinic instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For PCR tests, travellers will receive a digitally authenticated and endorsed test result via email with the help of the clinic. No further action is required on the traveller's part to get the result digitally endorsed. You may use the QR code within the digital certificate to support checks during boarding and immigration clearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Should you require a digitally endorsed ART result for travel, check with the clinic administering the test whether they are able to support the issuance.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">https://www.notarise.gov.sg/</a>.</p>

### 4) Digitally Authenticated Vaccination Certificate

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">All hardcopy vaccination cards/ slips issued in Singapore, as well as vaccination records found on mobile applications such as <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/" target="_blank">HealthHub</a> may not be accepted for use overseas where digital verification might be required i.e. scanning the QR codes on your digital vaccination certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who are vaccinated in Singapore and are required by foreign authorities to show digitally verifiable proof of vaccination should obtain a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate (‘Vaccination HealthCert’) at <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a>. Upon successful application, the Vaccination HealthCert will be sent by Notαrise to the traveller’s email and/or Singpass app (for users who logged in using Singpass app/ credentials). Foreign authorities will be able to scan the QR codes on the certificate to digitally verify that the certificate is authentic.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Please note that while Singapore's Pre-Departure Test (PDT) and Vaccination HealthCerts are considered equivalent to the EU Digital Covid Certificate (DCC), your destination may be using reader applications that are unable to validate offline QR codes. You can ask the authorities/businesses if verification can also be done by scanning the online QR code with a mobile device connected to the internet.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">From 1 February 2022, EU DCCs for vaccination may be recognised up to 270 days* after an individual’s completion of the primary vaccination series (i.e. after the 2nd shot for two dose vaccination). As a traveller, you may need to obtain a booster vaccination for travel based on these guidelines, and get your Vaccination HealthCert reissued on the Notαrise portal if required. Do always check the requirements of your destination country first prior to travel.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:16px; line-height:1.35;">*<i>This is based on the European Commissions’ recommendation for travel to Europe. The rules of EU member states may vary, and you are recommended to perform checks on the requirements of your destination country prior to travel.</i></p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who have an expiring Foreign Identification Number (FIN) are advised to get their Vaccination HealthCert early or can read more <a href="https://faq.notarise.gov.sg/hc/en-gb/articles/4573705170713-Who-can-obtain-a-Vaccination-HealthCert-" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
