### 1) Departure Advisories and Requirements

<ol style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:lower-alpha">
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Travel advisories</b> - Singapore residents who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated are advised to defer all travel except in exceptional circumstances. For fully vaccinated residents, travel to high-risk countries/regions is discouraged. All departing travellers should review the latest <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory/#travel_advisory" target="_blank">Ministry of Health travel advisory</a> and <a href="https://www.mfa.gov.sg/where-are-you-travelling-to" target="_blank">specific destination advisories from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</a> </li>
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Requirements for departing from Singapore</b> – Travellers do not need specific approval to leave Singapore. However, all travellers including Vaccinated Travel Lane (Air) and <a href="/vtl-land/outbound-travel" target="_blank">Vaccinated Travel Lane (Land)</a> users should check with the authorities of the destination country/region on the requirements imposed on travellers departing from Singapore, including whether a pre-departure test and digital health and vaccine certificates are required. Travellers may also utilise <a href="/rgl/visiting-rgl-counterparts" target="_blank">Reciprocal Green Lane</a> outbound arrangements to travel to Mainland China and Brunei. </li>
  <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Requirements for returning to Singapore</b> - Travellers who intend to return to Singapore should note that the prevailing entry requirements will apply for their return to Singapore. For more details on entry requirements and SafeTravel Lanes available, refer to the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page. Travellers who are required to obtain entry approval before returning to Singapore (e.g. long term pass holders, work pass holders, student pass holders) are advised to secure an entry date before leaving Singapore, if they require certainty of a return date.</li>
</ol>

### 2) Obtaining a Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test in Singapore for Overseas Travel 

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who are required by their destination country/region to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test must <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/licensing-and-regulation/regulations-guidelines-and-circulars/details/list-of-covid-19-swab-providers" target="_blank">book an appointment with any clinic found on this list</a>. As a general guide, travellers who present themselves at a clinic less than 38 hours before their flight will not receive their pre-departure test result on time. Travellers are therefore strongly encouraged to allocate sufficient lead time when scheduling a test appointment.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">On the day of the test, travellers should bring the following documents to the clinic:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; list-style-type:disc;">
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Identity card (for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders)</li> 
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Passport</li>
 <li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Flight booking details showing the departure timing</li>
</ol>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For details related to the cost and administration of the test, travellers should enquire directly with the clinic. Travellers should note that government subsidies cannot be used to offset the cost of the test, and a test memo will not be issued for any government-paid-for tests.</p>

### 3) Digitally Authenticated Outbound Pre-departure COVID-19 Test Result

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who have taken a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) or Antigen Rapid Test ("ART") in Singapore for overseas travel will receive a digital test result certificate. Those who are unable to receive a digital certificate or have taken a COVID-19 test that is not a PCR test can request a hardcopy certificate from the clinic instead.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">For PCR tests, travellers will receive a digitally authenticated and endorsed test result via email with the help of the clinic. No further action is required on the traveller's part to get the result digitally endorsed. You may use the QR code within the digital certificate to support checks during boarding and immigration clearance.</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who do not receive their QR code or encounter any technical difficulties while authenticating their digital result certificate may write to <a href="mailto:support@notarise.gov.sg">support@notarise.gov.sg</a> for assistance, or refer to <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/faq" target="_blank">this FAQ</a>.</p>

### 4) Digitally Authenticated Vaccination Certificate

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">All hardcopy vaccination cards/ slips issued in Singapore, as well as vaccination records found on mobile applications such as <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/" target="_blank">HealthHub</a> may not be accepted for use overseas where digital verification might be required i.e. scanning the QR codes on your digital vaccination certificate.</p>

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who are vaccinated in Singapore and are required by foreign authorities to show digitally verifiable proof of vaccination should obtain a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate (‘Vaccination HealthCert’) at <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a>. Upon successful application, the Vaccination HealthCert will be sent by Notαrise to the traveller’s email and/or Singpass app (for users who logged in using Singpass app/ credentials). Foreign authorities will be able to scan the QR codes on the certificate to digitally verify that the certificate is authentic.</p>

<!--<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;"><b>Travellers who had previously obtained their Vaccination HealthCert before 7 Dec 2021</b> should visit <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a> again to obtain a new Vaccination HealthCert which will now include additional offline verification QRs. These additional QRs will ease the digital verification of their Vaccination HealthCert within the European Union (EU) or in countries/regions which recognise Singapore’s EU Digital COVID certificate.</p>-->

<p style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:20px; line-height:1.35;">Travellers who generated offline QR codes before 10 Dec and are experiencing vaccination expiry date issues during verification should regenerate their QR codes on <a href="https://www.notarise.gov.sg/" target="_blank">Notαrise</a>. Please note that while Singapore's Pre-Departure Test (PDT) and Vaccination HealthCerts are considered equivalent to the EU DCC, your destination may be using reader applications that are unable to validate offline QR codes. You can ask the authorities/businesses if verification can also be done by scanning the online QR code with a mobile device connected to the internet.</p>
