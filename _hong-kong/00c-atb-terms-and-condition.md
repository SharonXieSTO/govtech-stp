The requirement in Condition 1(c) to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the flight departing from Hong Kong does not apply to an Air Travel Pass holder who is 6 years of age or younger in that calendar year.

The requirement in Condition 1(d) to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport upon arrival in Singapore does not apply to an Air Travel Pass holder who is 6 years of age or younger in that calendar year.

The Air Travel Pass is only valid for a single entry into Singapore. Such entry must be during the approved period stated in the Air Travel Pass approval.

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may, at their own discretion, introduce new measures or requirements to safeguard public health, which may include variation of the conditions or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass at short notice.

An Air Travel Pass holder’s entry and stay in Singapore are subject to compliance with the prevailing immigration requirements of the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”), including compliance with the conditions of the Air Travel Pass. For the purpose of determining whether the conditions of the Air Travel Pass are being complied with, a public officer, including an officer of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (“CAAS”), or an officer acting on behalf of the CAAS, may request to see the Air Travel Pass. Upon receipt of such a request, an Air Travel Pass holder must show his or her Air Travel Pass to the officer. Non-compliance with any of the prevailing immigration requirements or conditions of the Air Travel Pass may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass. In such an event, the Air Travel Pass holder may be liable for the cost of his/her repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected.
