<u>Travellers will not be subject to a quarantine</u> and there will be no restriction on movement. They must comply with the prevailing health and social distancing measures in Hong Kong. Please refer [here](https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/reduce-gatherings.html) for information on the prevailing measures in Hong Kong.

Should travellers, who are non-Hong Kong residents, become COVID-19 positive while in Hong Kong, they will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the Hong Kong Government.  Such travellers will need to bear the full cost of any medical treatment provided to them.

### 5. Returning to Singapore
 
#### After staying in Hong Kong, travellers may return to Singapore using the ATB or proceed on to another country/region.  
 
For travellers returning to Singapore on the ATB, there is no need to apply for an Air Travel Pass to enter Singapore. However, <u>Long-Term Pass holders will have to seek entry approval before travelling to Singapore (please apply via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Student’s Pass Holder Lane or Familial Ties Lane depending on your pass type)</u>.  
 
Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders may take either:

(A) a flight designated by the Singapore Government and Hong Kong Government under the ATB; or
(B) a non-designated flight.

They must ensure that they meet the requirements of the type of flight that they are taking.

<b><u>(A) Designated ATB Flights</u></b>

For those travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore on a flight designated by the Singapore Government and Hong Kong Government under the ATB, they will be allowed to go about their activities upon entry into Singapore, without a need to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

In order to be eligible to take a designated ATB flight, they are required to:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type:disc;">
         <li style="font-size:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.5;">remain in Hong Kong and/or Singapore in the last 14 consecutive days before departure from Hong Kong; and </li> 
          <li style="font-size:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore at one of the <a href="http://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/pdf/List_of_recognised_laboratories_RTPCR.pdf">testing institutions</a> recognised by the Hong Kong Government, and obtain a test result certificate in English stating the following:
            <ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
         <li style="font-size:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.5;">Traveller’s name, date of birth, and passport number (as indicated in his/her passport);</li> 
          <li style="font-size:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">A negative COVID-19 PCR test result;</li>  
               <li style="font-size:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Date and time when the COVID-19 PCR test was taken; and</li>  
               <li style="font-size:20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Name of the testing institution where the test was taken.</li>  
            </ol>
  </li>  
      </ol>

Travellers are responsible for making their own appointments with the testing institutions in Hong Kong to take their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. They must also bear the cost of their test. Please check with the listed testing institutions for the cost of the test.

All Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders arriving on designated ATB flights will be required to take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at Changi Airport.

After taking the test, Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders are required to immediately take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their own accommodation. They must remain isolated at their accommodation until their test result is confirmed to be negative. After being notified of their negative test results, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.

Children aged 6 or younger in that calendar year are not required to:
- undergo a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore; and 
- undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport upon arrival in Singapore.


<b><u>(B) Non-Designated ATB Flights</u></b>

For those travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore on a non-designated flight, they will be required to serve a 7-day SHN at their own accommodation upon entry into Singapore and undergo a COVID-19 PCR test during the SHN period. For more information on the prevailing SHN and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore, please refer to the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority’s (ICA) website [here](https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/).

There is no need to undergo a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test in Hong Kong for those travelling on non-designated flights.
