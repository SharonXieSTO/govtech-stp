### A) General Queries

#### 1. What is a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement for travel to Singapore?

The SafeTravel Pass issued under the RGL arrangement is a non-transferrable single-entry travel document. It allows a traveller to seek short-term essential business and official visit into Singapore within a stipulated week (0000 hours Monday to 2359 hours Sundays), where he/she can remain in Singapore for the duration stipulated in the visit pass issued at the immigration counters of Singapore.

#### 2. Is there a limit to the number of times I can apply for a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement?

There is no limit to the number of times a traveller can be sponsored for a SafeTravel Pass under the RGL arrangement. However, as each SafeTravel pass is only valid for single-entry into Singapore, each new entry will require a fresh application by the sponsor. While there is no cap on the number of times a traveller can be sponsored for entry under the RGL, there may be penalties in repeated cases of non-utilisation (i.e. no show).

#### 3. I intend to visit Singapore, but I do not qualify for RGL. Is there another SafeTravel Pass that I apply for entry into Singapore? 

You can check [here](/arriving/overview) for the available SafeTravel lanes to visit Singapore. Prospective travellers cannot apply for the SafeTravel Pass-RGL themselves; all RGL applications must be submitted by a company or government agency in Singapore via this [link](http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO).

#### 4. I was recently diagnosed with COVID-19 but am scheduled to travel to Singapore. Can I still visit Singapore?

In general, travellers who are unwell should seek for immediate medical attention and defer their travels. Travellers diagnosed with [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) less than 21 days before the scheduled date of arrival in Singapore will not be permitted travel to Singapore; airlines will deny such travellers from boarding.

#### 5. I was approved to travel to Singapore under the RGL. Can I transit through a second country to get to Singapore? What should my travel route look like?

RGL travellers are only allowed to travel to Singapore via a non-stop flight from selected airports (below) in the counterpart countries/regions; transits (via a non-RGL-counterpart country) is prohibited.

#### 7. What is the application window and processing time for the SafeTravel Pass application under the RGL arrangement?

The application for the SafeTravel Pass is open for a period of two to five weeks before the week of the traveller’s planned departure to Singapore. As applications can take up to seven days (excluding the day of application) to process, any application submitted less than eight days from the planned date of entry will not be accepted.

Application sponsors should apply for the SafeTravel Pass-RGL as soon as practicable. Sponsors should take into consideration the time involved forapplication and visa processing (if required), as well as the mandatory pre-departure [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) before departure for Singapore. That aside, application sponsors should note that the hosting company or government agency must submit a copy of the traveller’s 14-day controlled itinerary at least a day before the travellers’ arrival in Singapore.

#### 8. How will I be notified of the outcome of the SafeTravel Pass application?

The applicant sponsor will be notified of the outcome of the SafeTravel Pass application via the email provided in the application. 

Sponsors may also enquire about the application status [here](http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO) using the traveller’s identification details and intended date of arrival in Singapore.

#### 9. I noticed a mistake in the application that I had submitted. What should I do to address the error? 

Amendments cannot be made once an application is submitted . Application sponsors should therefore ensure that all application details are accurate at the point of submission.

#### 10. What should I do if there are changes in the 14-day controlled itinerary submitted?

As a [condition](/rgl/terms-and-conditions) for entry into Singapore, travellers approved under the RGL arrangement must adhere to the controlled itinerary submitted. Failure to do so can result in the immediate revocation of the SafeTravel Pass and termination of the visit pass. Application sponsors should therefore ensure that the controlled itinerary submitted is accurate. Should there be any changes in the itinerary, application sponsors can write to <COVID_SafeTravelEnquiries@mti.gov.sg> with the approved SafeTravel Pass reference and revised controlled itinerary. 

#### 11. Why was my application rejected?

Safe Travel Pass applications may be rejected for one or more of the following reasons:
- Inadequate justifications for reason of travel
- Non-compliant 14-day controlled itinerary
- Invalid proof of residency
- Insufficient quota for the intended week of entry

<div id="rgltravellers"></div>

### C) For RGL Travellers

<div id="visa"></div>

### Visa Applications and Visit Pass Extensions

#### 12. How do I know if I need a visa to visit Singapore? If I need a visa, how can I apply for one? 

Travellers should check [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteringanddeparting/before/entryvisa/) on whether a visa is required for their entry into Singapore. 

Travellers from visa-exempted countries do not need to apply for a visa. However, travellers who that require a visa to enter Singapore, can apply for a visa through the Singapore overseas missions, authorised visa agents, a local contact or company at least four working days before departure to Singapore; the granting of visas will depend on the merits of each application. Click [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save) to apply. 

#### 13. How do I extend my visit pass/stay in Singapore, if necessary?

Requests to extend the visit pass/stay in Singapore must be made at least seven days before the expiry of the visit pass. An application for extension can be only be submitted online using ICA’s [e-Service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend), and the granting of extension will depend on the merits of each application. ICA no longer accepts over the counter extension requests.

<div id="pre-departure"></div>

### Mandatory Pre-Departure to Singapore Preparation 

#### 14. What pre-departure requirements must I comply with before entering Singapore?

Three days before the travellers’ scheduled entry into Singapore, the application sponsor must submit the following:
- Pre-trip health and travel history declarations and accommodation details electronically via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/); and
- Traveller’s certificate of negative test result for COVID-19 (taken within 72 hours before departure at authorised testing facilities), and latest 14-day controlled itinerary in Singapore [here](http://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO).

#### 15. What documents do I need show to the airline during boarding and at Singapore’s immigration checkpoint?

RGL travellers entering Singapore via air and land transport must produce the following documents:
- A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry to Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter).
- A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore).
- A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be issued by an authorised COVID-19 testing facility designated by the government of the country/region the traveller is departing from.) The certificate should also be in English or accompanied by an English translation.
- Proof of return transportation arrangements to depart from Singapore (e.g. air, train and bus return ticket). Travellers arriving by air who do not produce a return air ticket during pre-boarding checks may be refused boarding.

<div id="covid19"></div>

### COVID-19 Test on Arrival in Singapore

#### 16. What COVID-19 tests am I required to take upon arrival in Singapore? Where will the tests be administered, and what are the available payment modes?

All RGL travellers are required to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”). Travellers entering Singapore by air are encouraged to [pre-register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/) for the PCR test, while travellers entering Singapore via land will pay on the day of arrival. Click [here](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) for more information on the tests and corresponding cost.

In general, travellers should, upon arrival, identify themselves as travellers of the RGL scheme to an airport or checkpoint officer. Upon confirmation of their RGL approved status, travellers will be brought to the swabbing station within Changi Airport, Seletar Airport, Woodlands or Tuas Checkpoints in Singapore for the test.

#### 17.What happens if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore? Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills?

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will be given medical attention/treatment immediately. The cost of the relevant medical treatments will be borne in full by the travellers. As such travellers are required be insured for any COVID-19 related medical treatment before travelling to Singapore. Click [here](/health/travelinsurance) for more information on this requirement.

Singapore Citizens and PRs may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Pass Holders may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance, where applicable.

<div id ="publichealth"></div>

### Public Health Safeguards in Singapore

#### 18. What health measures will I be subjected to upon arrival in Singapore?

Travellers should refer to the relevant Terms & Conditions, which will be issued with the approval letter, for details on the health measures that they must observe upon arrival in Singapore. Travellers can click [here](/rgl/terms-and-conditions) to view the Terms and Conditions.

In general, RGL travellers must take a [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) upon arrival in Singapore. They will then commute immediately using a vehicle arranged by the host company/government agency to their declared self-sourced accommodation until a negative PCR test result is released (typically within 48 hours). Travellers and application sponsors should note that the declared accommodation during the first 14 days of stay in Singapore must be a non-residential address. Any cost incurred, e.g. post-arrival PCR test in Singapore and stay in the declared accommodation, will be borne by the traveller. Failure to comply with any of these requirements may result in the immediate revocation of the Safe Travel Pass.

Travellers can leave their accommodation only if they are tested negative for COVID-19 in Singapore. All travellers are required to adhere strictly to the controlled itinerary submitted; access to common facilities/amenities in the declared accommodation, which is beyond the scope of his/her declared business activities in Singapore, is prohibited. Travellers are also prohibited from taking public transportation during their stay in Singapore and can only commute using private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport that the host company/government agency may arrange.

Travellers should take their temperature twice daily and report their health status to the host company/government agency. During their stay in Singapore, travellers must adhere to prevailing public health requirements, which includes the use of the TraceTogether mobile application and SafeEntry.

#### 19. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track my movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s phone and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

The app works best on phones with Android version 5.1 and above, as well as phones with iOS version 10 and above. More information on the app can be found [here](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/).

#### 20. What is SafeEntry?
SafeEntry is a national digital check-in system that logs the NRIC/FIN and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters.

An existing check-in method is via scanning of a QR code at the venue with a camera phone or a QR scanner app. Hence, you are encouraged to purchase a Singapore local data SIM card, or connect your mobile phone to a Singapore local Wi-Fi network to access the form for this mode of check-in.

Alternatively, some venues allow you to complete SafeEntry by presenting your passport as identification. Establishments will assist visitors with manual SafeEntry check-in.

More information on the system can be found [here](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/).

#### 21. I was identified as a close contact of a confirmed COVID-19 case. What does it mean?

Close contacts of an active COVID-19 case will be identified by MOH through contact tracing. Individuals assess to be a close contact of an active COVID-19 case may be issued a quarantine order (QO) under the Infectious Diseases Act. Click [here](https://www.gov.sg/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-quarantine-orders) for more on the QO. Affected travellers should extend their visit pass, if duration of the QO exceeds the visit pass’ validity period.

### Return to Countries/Regions of Departure

#### 22. Do I need to be tested again before I return to my origin country/region of departure? What health measures will I be subjected to upon return to my country/region of departure?

As the specific requirements may change over time, RGL travellers returning to their country/region of departure should verify the latest requirements with the respective country/region’s government.
