### Requirements and process for the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)

#### 1. When is the latest I can submit my entry application?

<a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">Fully vaccinated</a> Student’s Pass (STP) and Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders, including In-Principle Approval (IPA) holders, may travel to Singapore <b>without</b> the need to apply for an entry approval. They must show their long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint for entry to Singapore.

<a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Eligible short-term visitors</a> who do not hold Singapore long-term passes must submit their entry applications <b><u>at least one week before their intended period of travel</u></b>, and up to nine weeks in advance.

Prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">health protocols</a> will continue to apply to all travellers. To enjoy quarantine-free measures, travellers departing from Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) countries/regions may consider entering Singapore under the VTL instead. 


#### 2. I have obtained an entry approval, but I would like to change the validity period.

We seek your understanding that the validity period of entry approvals cannot be amended, once issued. 

If you had made payment for your earlier entry application, please note that this is non-refundable.

In the meantime, you may wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.


#### 3. I am a Student's Pass (STP) holder in a post-graduate programme. Can my spouse and children seek entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) as well? 

The spouse and children of STP holders on post-graduate programme are eligible for entry via the STPHL. 

If they are <a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> and hold Student’s Passes, ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Passes, or the In-Principle Approval (IPA) of these passes, they may travel to Singapore <b>without</b> the need to apply for an entry approval. They must show their long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint.

If they do not hold any Singapore long-term passes, you may submit an entry application for your spouse and children <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-entry-application" target="_blank">here</a>.


#### 4. I would like appeal for an Entry Approval for my child and I to enter Singapore so that he/she can sit for tests conducted as part of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).

Entry approval will not be issued for applicants to sit for the AEIS tests.  

Travellers seeking to enter Singapore should ensure they are eligible for entry via one of the <a href="/arriving/overview">SafeTravel Lanes</a>.

Only Student's Pass (STP) holders, Student's Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holders and [eligible family members](/stpl/overview) may apply for entry through the Student's Pass Holder's Lane (STPHL).


#### 5. My flight has been cancelled or delayed, and I will be travelling on another date. Can I still travel using my existing entry approval?

<a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">Fully vaccinated</a> Student’s Pass (STP) and Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders, including In-Principle Approval (IPA) holders: You may enter Singapore on your new arrival date <b>without</b> the need to apply for another entry approval.

<a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Eligible short-term visitors</a> who do not hold Singapore long-term passes: If you are travelling within the validity period of your entry approval, you may use your existing entry approval. However, if you are now travelling outside of the validity period, you will need to submit a new application <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-entry-application" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Student's Pass Holders who are considering travel under the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL)

#### 8. If I am entering from a country that Singapore has established a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) with, what are the requirements for entry approval?

Fully Vaccinated Student’s Pass (STP)/STP-In Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holders and eligible family members from a VTL (Air/Land) country can enter Singapore either:

<ol>
  <li style="line-height:1.5;">Under the vaccinated Travel Lanes (<a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">Air</a> / <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">Land</a>/ <a href="/vtl-sea/overview" target="_blank">Sea</a>): Obtain a valid Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) <b>at least 3 days before </b>planned arrival.<br><br>STP, Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) and the respective IPA holders may travel to Singapore via the VTL without applying for a Vaccinated Travel Pass, subject to the prevailing VTL requirements. <br><br> To be eligible for the VTLs, the traveller must only have travel history to Singapore, <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries" target="_blank">VTL countries</a> or <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank"> Category I countries/regions</a>, can only arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL flight/bus/ferry, and must satisfy all conditions under the VTL (Air / Land / Sea).</li>
  <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>OR</b></p>
  <li style="line-height:1.5;">Under the <a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)</a>:<p>STP, Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) and the respective IPA holders may travel to Singapore without applying for an entry approval, subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a>. They must show their long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint.</p><p><a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Eligible short-term visitors</a> who do not hold Singapore long-term passes must apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-entry-application" target="_blank">here</a> <b>at least one week before</b> their intended period of travel. They will be subject to the prevailing SHN <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a>.</p><p>Please also note that all payments made for entry applications under the STPHL are <b>non-refundable</b>, and <b>cannot be transferred</b> to offset payments required under the VTL.</p></li>
  </ol> 

Travellers who do not fulfil the requirements of the respective travel lanes on arrival will be denied entry into Singapore.



#### 9. Do I still need to obtain an entry approval under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) if I want to enter Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)?

No, you are not required to apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the STPHL if you are travelling via the VTL. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a>, <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a> and <a href="/vtl-sea/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Sea)</a>.


#### 10. I am travelling from a country that Singapore has established a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) with. I have previously obtained an entry approval under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL). Will I still be required to serve the 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

If you enter Singapore via the STPHL, you will need to fulfill the prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category II/III/IV travel and health control measures</a>, including serving a 7-day SHN at a self-sourced accommodation.

If you wish to enter Singapore without having to serve SHN, you will need to enter Singapore via the VTL. STP, Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) and the respective IPA holders may travel to Singapore via VTL without applying for a Vaccinated Travel Pass, subject to the prevailing VTL requirements. They must show their long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint. They must also enter Singapore on a designated VTL flight, bus or ferry service. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a>, <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a> and <a href="/vtl-sea/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Sea)</a>.

Please also note that payments made for the entry application under the STPHL are non-refundable, and also cannot be transferred to offset payments required under the VTL. However, if you obtained your entry approval under the STPHL before the announcement of the VTL, and later enter Singapore under the VTL, you may be eligible for a refund.


#### 11. Can I apply for both an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) and a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)?

If you are a <a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> Student’s Pass (STP), Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP), or their respective In-Principle Approval (IPA) holder, you may travel to Singapore under the STPHL <b>without</b> the need to apply for an entry approval, <b>subject to prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a></b>.

For SHN-free travel, you may also enter via the VTL without applying for a VTP, but must meet the prevailing VTL requirements. This includes entering Singapore on a designated VTL flight, bus or ferry service. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a>, <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a> and <a href="/vtl-sea/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Sea)</a>.

If you are an <a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">eligible short-term visitor</a>, you may apply for both a SafeTravel Pass under the STPHL and a VTP under the VTL for the same travel period. However, please note that if you had applied for the SafeTravel Pass after the announcement of the VTL, the fees you have paid under the STPHL will be non-refundable, and also cannot be transferred to offset payments required under the VTL.


#### 12. If I am unable to secure a seat on a designated flight under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL), can I apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

If you are a <a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> Student’s Pass (STP), Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP), or their respective In-Principle Approval (IPA) holder, you may travel to Singapore under the STPHL <b>without</b> the need to apply for an entry approval, <b>subject to prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a></b>. You must show your long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint. 

If you are an <a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">eligible short-term visitor</a>, you may apply for an entry approval under the STPHL, <b>subject to prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a></b>. However, this must be done <b>at least one week before your intended period of travel</b>. Appeals to expedite the application process will not be accepted.
