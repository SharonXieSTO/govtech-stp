### Requirements and process for the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)

#### 1. When is the latest I can submit my entry application?

##### [For arrivals before 21 February 2022, 2359 hours]

Applicants are required to submit their entry applications <u><b>at least two weeks before their intended period of travel</b></u>.

##### [For arrivals from 21 February 2022, 2359 hours]

<a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">Fully vaccinated</a> Student’s Pass (STP) and Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) holders, including In-Principle Approval (IPA) holders, may travel to Singapore <b>without</b> the need to apply for an entry approval. They must show their long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint for entry to Singapore.

<a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Eligible short-term visitors</a> who do not hold Singapore long-term passes must submit their entry applications <b><u>at least one week before their intended period of travel</u></b>, and up to nine weeks in advance.

Prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">health protocols</a> will continue to apply to all travellers. To enjoy quarantine-free measures, travellers departing from Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) countries/regions may consider entering Singapore under the VTL instead. 



<!--#### 2. I am a Student’s Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holder. When applying for entry through the SafeTravel portal, I received the error message “Invalid IPA number”.

Please ensure that all details have been entered accurately, including your name and date of birth.

For your name, please type it as shown in your passport biodata page. If your name contains a hyphen ( - ), slash ( / ), at ( @ ) or apostrophe ( ‘ ), please include them. All other special characters will not be accepted in the entry application. For example, if your name contains a comma ( , ), please exclude it. 

If your name contains any other special characters, please follow the machine-readable zone of the passport. An illustration can be found <a href="/faq/tech#TravellerDetails">here</a> to show how to locate the passport’s machine readable zone. 

You may also try entering your name in a different sequence.  For example, try entering both ‘John Smith’ and ‘Smith John’, or ‘Tan Jia Hui’ and ‘Jia Hui Tan’.

Should you still encounter the error message after trying the above, please submit a SafeTravel Enquiry Form <a href="/contact-us">here</a>, and provide us with the following to facilitate our investigation of the issue:
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>screenshot of the application details and error message;</li>
<li>STP-IPA letter; and</li> 
<li>Passport biodata page</li>
</ol>-->

#### 2. I have obtained an entry approval, but I would like to change the validity period.

We seek your understanding that the validity period of entry approvals cannot be amended, once issued. 

If you had made payment for your earlier entry application, please note that this is non-refundable.

In the meantime, you may wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.


#### 3. I am a Student's Pass (STP) holder in a post-graduate programme. Can my spouse and children seek entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) as well? 

The spouse and children of STP holders on post-graduate programme are eligible for entry via the STPHL. 

From 21 February 2022, 2359 hours, if they are <a href="/stpl/vaccination-requirements" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> and hold Student’s Passes, ICA-issued Long-Term Visit Passes, or the In-Principle Approval (IPA) of these passes, they may travel to Singapore <b>without</b> the need to apply for an entry approval. They must show their long-term pass/IPA letter and proof of vaccination status at the port of departure/ checkpoint.

If they do not hold any Singapore long-term passes, you may submit an entry application for your spouse and children <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moe-entry-application" target="_blank">here</a>.


#### 4. I would like appeal for an Entry Approval for my child and I to enter Singapore so that he/she can sit for tests conducted as part of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).

Entry approval will not be issued for applicants to sit for the AEIS tests.  

Travellers seeking to enter Singapore should ensure they are eligible for entry via one of the <a href="/arriving/overview">SafeTravel Lanes</a>.

Only Student's Pass (STP) holders, Student's Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holders and [eligible family members](/stpl/overview) may apply for entry through the Student's Pass Holder's Lane (STPHL).


#### 5. My flight has been cancelled or delayed, and I will be travelling on another date. Can I still travel using my existing entry approval?

##### [For arrivals before 21 February 2022, 2359 hours] 

If you are travelling within the validity period of your entry approval, you may use your existing entry approval. However, if you are now travelling outside of the validity period, please refer to the below.

#### 8. I have recovered from a COVID-19 infection and have 1 dose of a PSAR approved vaccine. Am I considered fully vaccinated? Can I apply for an entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

Travellers are considered fully vaccinated if they have received 1 dose of a PSAR-approved vaccine after recovering from a COVID-19 infection. The vaccination should be taken no earlier than 3 months from the date of their diagnosis, if they had not already completed vaccination previously. 

However, to ensure smooth boarding and immigration clearance, such travellers will need to obtain an exemption letter from the Ministry of Education. They may do so by submitting an application [here](https://go.gov.sg/moe-vaccination-exemption). They do <b><u>not</u></b> submit an entry application via the [SafeTravel Portal](https://go.gov.sg/stphl-application).


<div id="vtl"></div>

### Student's Pass Holders who are considering travel under the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL)

#### 9. If I am entering from a country that Singapore has established a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) with, what are the requirements for entry approval? 

Fully Vaccinated STP/STP-IPA holders from a VTL (Air/Land) country can enter Singapore either: 

<ol>
  <li style="line-height:1.5;">Under the vaccinated Travel Lanes (<a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">Air</a> / <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">Land</a>): Obtain a valid Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) <b>at least 3 days before </b>planned arrival. <br><br> To be eligible for the VTLs, the traveller must only have travel history to Singapore, <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries" target="_blank">VTL countries</a> or <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank"> Category I countries/regions</a>, can only arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL flight/bus, and must satisfy all conditions under the VTL (Air / Land).</li>
  <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>OR</b></p>
  <li style="line-height:1.5;">Under the <a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)</a>: Obtain a valid entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) at least 2 weeks before your planned arrival. Applications can be made <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO1/STPHL" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>The STP/STP-IPA holder will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a>. <br/><br/> Please also note that all payments made for entry applications under the STPHL are <b>non-refundable</b>, and also <b>cannot be transferred</b> to offset payments required under the VTL </li>
  </ol> 
  
STP/STP-IPA holders who do not fulfil the requirements of the respective travel lanes on arrival will be denied entry into Singapore.

#### 10. Do I still need to obtain an entry approval under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) if I want to enter Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)?

No, you are not required to apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the STPHL if you are travelling via the VTL. If you are travelling via the VTL, you will need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) instead. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a> and <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a>.


#### 11. I am travelling from a country that Singapore has established a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) with. I have previously obtained an entry approval under the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL). Will I still be required to serve the 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

If you enter Singapore using the entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) obtained under the STPHL, you will need to fulfill the prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category II travel and health control measures</a>, including serving a 7-day SHN at a self-sourced accommodation.

If you wish to enter Singapore without having to serve SHN, you will need to obtain a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) under the Vaccinated Travel Lane. You must also enter Singapore on a designated VTL flight or bus service. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a> and <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a>.

Please also note that payments made for the entry application under the STPHL are non-refundable, and also cannot be transferred to offset payments required under the VTL. However, if you obtained your entry approval under the STPHL before the announcement of the VTL, and later enter Singapore under the VTL, you may be eligible for a refund.

#### 12. Can I apply for both an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) and a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)?

You may apply for both a SafeTravel Pass under the STPHL and a VTP under the VTL for the same travel period. However, please note that if you had applied for the SafeTravel Pass after the announcement of the VTL, the fees you have paid under the STPHL will be non-refundable, and also cannot be transferred to offset payments required under the VTL. 


#### 13. If I am unable to secure a seat on a designated flight under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL), can I apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

Yes, you may apply for an entry approval under the STPHL. However, this must be done <b>at least two weeks before your intended period of travel</b>. Appeals for travel periods that not available on the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO1/STPHL" target="_blank">STPHL application portal</a> will not be accepted. 
Travellers who enter under the STPHL will be subject to the prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">border measures</a>, including having to serve a Stay-Home Notice.
