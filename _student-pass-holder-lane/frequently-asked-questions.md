#### 1. When is the latest I can submit my entry application?

Applicants are required to submit their entry applications <u><b>at least two weeks before their intended period of travel</b></u>.

In addition, as entry approvals have been reduced for travellers with recent travel history to higher-risk countries/regions (i.e., all countries/regions, except countries/regions listed in Category (I) and (II) of the table [here](/stpl/shn-and-swab-summary)), such travellers are encouraged to try applying for entry in the SafeTravel application portal up to five weeks before their intended travel period. Those who are unable to secure their desired period of entry are advised to check for new entry periods the following week, or defer their travels until the situation has stabilised.

#### 2. I am a Student’s Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holder. When applying for entry through the SafeTravel portal, I received the error message “Invalid IPA number”.

Please ensure that all details have been entered accurately, including your name and date of birth.

For your name, please type it as shown in your passport biodata page. If your name contains a hyphen ( - ), slash ( / ), at ( @ ) or apostrophe ( ‘ ), please include them. All other special characters will not be accepted in the entry application. For example, if your name contains a comma ( , ), please exclude it. 

If your name contains any other special characters, please follow the machine-readable zone of the passport. An illustration can be found <a href="/faq/tech#TravellerDetails">here</a> to show how to locate the passport’s machine readable zone. 

You may also try entering your name in a different sequence.  For example, try entering both ‘John Smith’ and ‘Smith John’, or ‘Tan Jia Hui’ and ‘Jia Hui Tan’.

Should you still encounter the error message after trying the above, please submit a SafeTravel Enquiry Form <a href="/contact-us">here</a>, and provide us with the following to facilitate our investigation of the issue:

<li>STP-IPA letter; and</li> 
<li>Passport biodata page</li>
</ol>

#### 3. I have obtained an entry approval, but I would like to change the validity period.

We seek your understanding that the validity period of entry approvals cannot been amended, once issued. 

If you wish to enter Singapore in a different period, please submit a new application via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">SafeTravel portal</a>. If you had made payment for your earlier entry application, please note that this is non-refundable.  

In the meantime, you may wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.

#### 4. With my current entry approval, I will not be back in time for the start of the new school term.

We understand that the new academic year is starting soon. However, we are unable to change the validity period of your entry approval. 

If you wish to enter Singapore in a different period, please submit a new application via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">SafeTravel portal</a>. If you had made payment for your earlier entry application, please note that this is non-refundable.  

In the meantime, you may wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.

#### 5. I am a STP/STP-IPA holder, and cannot find an entry date in the STO portal. I would like to appeal for entry as my school term has started/ is starting soon.

In view of the COVID-19 situation globally, new entry approvals have been reduced until further notice for all long-term pass holders with travel history to higher-risk countries/regions (i.e. all countries/regions, except countries/regions listed in Category (I) and (II) of the table [here](/stpl/shn-and-swab-summary)). 

We understand that the new academic year may have started or may be starting soon. However, we are currently unable to accede to any entry appeals due to the border restrictions that are in place. 

Please try applying via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">SafeTravel application portal</a> again early next week, when the next available entry dates open up for applications. In the meantime, you may also wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.

#### 6.  I am a Student’s Pass holder in a post-graduate programme. Can my spouse and children seek entry approval via the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) as well?
In view of the COVID-19 situation globally, new entry approvals have been reduced until further notice for all long-term pass holders with travel history to higher-risk countries/regions (i.e. all countries/regions, except Brunei, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China and New Zealand). 

If your 21-day travel history includes only  Brunei, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China or New Zealand, you may submit an entry appeal for your spouse and children <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">here</a>. 

If your 21-day travel history includes a higher-risk country/region, we advise you to apply for entry approval for yourself to enter Singapore first, via <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">this link</a>. When the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, you may then apply for your family to enter.

#### 7. I would like appeal for an Entry Approval for my child and I to enter Singapore so that he/she can sit for tests conducted as part of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).

Entry approval will not be issued for applicants to sit for the AEIS tests.  

Travellers seeking to enter Singapore should ensure they are eligible for entry via one of the <a href="/arriving/overview">SafeTravel Lanes</a>.

Only Student's Pass (STP) holders, Student's Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holders and [eligible family members](/stphl/requirements-and-process) may apply for entry through the Student's Pass Holder's Lane (STPHL).

#### 8. My flight has been cancelled or delayed, and I will be travelling on another date. Can I still travel using my existing entry approval?

If you are travelling within the validity period of your entry approval, you may use your existing entry approval. However, if you are now travelling outside of the validity period, you will need to submit a new application via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">SafeTravel portal</a>.
