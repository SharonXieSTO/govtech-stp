#### 1. When is the latest I can submit my entry application?

Applicants are required to submit their entry applications <u><b>at least two weeks before their intended period of travel</b></u>.

Travellers may apply for entry in the SafeTravel application portal up to five weeks before their intended travel period. As entry approvals are issued on a first-come-first-serve basis, travellers are encouraged to apply early, once their travel plans are firmed up. Those who are unable to secure their desired period of entry are advised to check for new entry periods the following week, or defer their travels until the situation has stabilised. 

#### 2. I am a Student’s Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holder. When applying for entry through the SafeTravel portal, I received the error message “Invalid IPA number”.

Please ensure that all details have been entered accurately, including your name and date of birth.

For your name, please type it as shown in your passport biodata page. If your name contains a hyphen ( - ), slash ( / ), at ( @ ) or apostrophe ( ‘ ), please include them. All other special characters will not be accepted in the entry application. For example, if your name contains a comma ( , ), please exclude it. 

If your name contains any other special characters, please follow the machine-readable zone of the passport. An illustration can be found <a href="/faq/tech#TravellerDetails">here</a> to show how to locate the passport’s machine readable zone. 

You may also try entering your name in a different sequence.  For example, try entering both ‘John Smith’ and ‘Smith John’, or ‘Tan Jia Hui’ and ‘Jia Hui Tan’.

Should you still encounter the error message after trying the above, please submit a SafeTravel Enquiry Form <a href="/contact-us">here</a>, and provide us with the following to facilitate our investigation of the issue:

#### 3. I have obtained an entry approval, but I would like to change the validity period.

We seek your understanding that the validity period of entry approvals cannot been amended, once issued. 

If you wish to enter Singapore in a different period, please submit a new application via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">SafeTravel portal</a>. If you had made payment for your earlier entry application, please note that this is non-refundable.  

In the meantime, you may wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.

#### 4. I am a Student's Pass (STP) holder in a post-graduate programme. Can my spouse and children seek entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) as well? 

The spouse and children of STP holders on post-graduate programme are eligible for entry via the STPHL. You may submit an entry application for your spouse and children [here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry)

#### 5. I would like appeal for an Entry Approval for my child and I to enter Singapore so that he/she can sit for tests conducted as part of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).

Entry approval will not be issued for applicants to sit for the AEIS tests.  

Travellers seeking to enter Singapore should ensure they are eligible for entry via one of the <a href="/arriving/overview">SafeTravel Lanes</a>.

Only Student's Pass (STP) holders, Student's Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holders and [eligible family members](/stpl/overview) may apply for entry through the Student's Pass Holder's Lane (STPHL).

#### 6. My flight has been cancelled or delayed, and I will be travelling on another date. Can I still travel using my existing entry approval?

If you are travelling within the validity period of your entry approval, you may use your existing entry approval. However, if you are now travelling outside of the validity period, you will need to submit a new application via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO">SafeTravel portal</a>.

#### 7. I am not yet fully vaccinated. Can I apply for an entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

For arrivals from 1 November 2021, 0001 hours, travellers entering Singapore under the Student's Pass Holder Lane must meet the [vaccination requirements](/stpl/vaccination-requirements) for entry. 

If you are aged below 12 years old at the point of arrival, the vaccination condition for entry will not apply to you. You may proceed with your entry application as described [here.](/stpl/overview)

If you are aged between 12 to less than 18 years old at the point of arrival, you may enter without proof of vaccination, on the condition that you complete the full vaccination regimen within two months after you arrive in Singapore. You may proceed with your entry application as described [here.](/stpl/overview)

If you are aged 18 years old and above at the point of arrival, you will have to be fully vaccinated before arrival. If you are medically ineligible for vaccination or have extenuating reasons for not being fully vaccinated before arrival, you may submit an entry appeal [here](https://go.gov.sg/moe-vaccination-exemption). Please submit your appeal at least 3 weeks before your intended date of entry. Please do <b><u>not</u></b> submit an entry application via the [SafeTravel Portal](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO)


#### 8. I have recovered from a COVID-19 infection and have 1 dose of a PSAR approved vaccine. Am i considered fully vaccinated? Can I apply for an entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

Travellers are considered fully vaccinated if they have received 1 dose of a PSAR-approved vaccine after recovering from a COVID-19 infection. The vaccination should be taken no earlier than 3 months from the date of their diagnosis, if they had not already completed vaccination previously. 

However, to ensure smooth boarding and immigration clearance, such travellers will need to obtain an exemption letter from the Ministry of Education. They may do so by submitting an application [here](https://go.gov.sg/moe-vaccination-exemption). They do <b><u>not</u></b> submit an entry application via the [SafeTravel Portal](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO)
