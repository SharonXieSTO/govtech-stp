### Requirements and process for the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)

#### 1. When is the latest I can submit my entry application?

Applicants are required to submit their entry applications <u><b>at least two weeks before their intended period of travel</b></u>.

Travellers may apply for entry in the SafeTravel application portal up to nine weeks before their intended travel period. As entry approvals are issued on a first-come-first-serve basis, travellers are encouraged to apply early, once their travel plans are firmed up. Those who are unable to secure their desired period of entry are advised to check for new entry periods the following week, or defer their travels until the situation has stabilised. 

#### 2. I am a Student’s Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holder. When applying for entry through the SafeTravel portal, I received the error message “Invalid IPA number”.

Please ensure that all details have been entered accurately, including your name and date of birth.

For your name, please type it as shown in your passport biodata page. If your name contains a hyphen ( - ), slash ( / ), at ( @ ) or apostrophe ( ‘ ), please include them. All other special characters will not be accepted in the entry application. For example, if your name contains a comma ( , ), please exclude it. 

If your name contains any other special characters, please follow the machine-readable zone of the passport. An illustration can be found <a href="/faq/tech#TravellerDetails">here</a> to show how to locate the passport’s machine readable zone. 

You may also try entering your name in a different sequence.  For example, try entering both ‘John Smith’ and ‘Smith John’, or ‘Tan Jia Hui’ and ‘Jia Hui Tan’.

Should you still encounter the error message after trying the above, please submit a SafeTravel Enquiry Form <a href="/contact-us">here</a>, and provide us with the following to facilitate our investigation of the issue:
<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
<li>screenshot of the application details and error message;</li>
<li>STP-IPA letter; and</li> 
<li>Passport biodata page</li>
</ol>

#### 3. I have obtained an entry approval, but I would like to change the validity period.

We seek your understanding that the validity period of entry approvals cannot been amended, once issued. 

If you wish to enter Singapore in a different period, please submit a new application via the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/stphl-application">SafeTravel portal</a>. If you had made payment for your earlier entry application, please note that this is non-refundable.  

In the meantime, you may wish to seek advice from your university/ school on your academic matters.

#### 4. I am a Student's Pass (STP) holder in a post-graduate programme. Can my spouse and children seek entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) as well? 

The spouse and children of STP holders on post-graduate programme are eligible for entry via the STPHL. You may submit an entry application for your spouse and children [here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry)

#### 5. I would like appeal for an Entry Approval for my child and I to enter Singapore so that he/she can sit for tests conducted as part of the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS).

Entry approval will not be issued for applicants to sit for the AEIS tests.  

Travellers seeking to enter Singapore should ensure they are eligible for entry via one of the <a href="/arriving/overview">SafeTravel Lanes</a>.

Only Student's Pass (STP) holders, Student's Pass In-Principle Approval (STP-IPA) holders and [eligible family members](/stpl/overview) may apply for entry through the Student's Pass Holder's Lane (STPHL).

#### 6. My flight has been cancelled or delayed, and I will be travelling on another date. Can I still travel using my existing entry approval?

If you are travelling within the validity period of your entry approval, you may use your existing entry approval. However, if you are now travelling outside of the validity period, you will need to submit a new application via the <a href="https://go.gov.sg/stphl-application">SafeTravel portal</a>.

<div id="vaccination"></div>

### Vaccination requirements for entry under the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)

#### 7. I am not yet fully vaccinated. Can I apply for an entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

For arrivals from 1 November 2021, 0001 hours, travellers entering Singapore under the Student's Pass Holder Lane must meet the [vaccination requirements](/stpl/vaccination-requirements) for entry. 

If you are aged below 12 years old at the point of arrival, the vaccination condition for entry will not apply to you. You may proceed with your entry application as described [here.](/stpl/overview)

If you are aged between 12 to less than 18 years old at the point of arrival, you may enter without proof of vaccination, on the condition that you complete the full vaccination regimen within two months after you arrive in Singapore. You may proceed with your entry application as described [here.](/stpl/overview)

If you are aged 18 years old and above at the point of arrival, you will have to be fully vaccinated before arrival. If you are medically ineligible for vaccination or have extenuating reasons for not being fully vaccinated before arrival, you may submit an entry appeal [here](https://go.gov.sg/moe-vaccination-exemption). Please submit your appeal at least 3 weeks before your intended date of entry. Please do <b><u>not</u></b> submit an entry application via the [SafeTravel Portal](https://go.gov.sg/stphl-application)

#### 8. I have recovered from a COVID-19 infection and have 1 dose of a PSAR approved vaccine. Am I considered fully vaccinated? Can I apply for an entry approval via the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

Travellers are considered fully vaccinated if they have received 1 dose of a PSAR-approved vaccine after recovering from a COVID-19 infection. The vaccination should be taken no earlier than 3 months from the date of their diagnosis, if they had not already completed vaccination previously. 

However, to ensure smooth boarding and immigration clearance, such travellers will need to obtain an exemption letter from the Ministry of Education. They may do so by submitting an application [here](https://go.gov.sg/moe-vaccination-exemption). They do <b><u>not</u></b> submit an entry application via the [SafeTravel Portal](https://go.gov.sg/stphl-application).

### Student's Pass Holders who are considering travel under the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL)

#### 9. If I am entering from a country that Singapore has established a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) with, what are the requirements for entry approval? 

Fully Vaccinated STP/STP-IPA holders from a VTL (Air/Land) country can enter Singapore either: 

<ol>
  <li style="line-height:1.5;">Under the vaccinated Travel Lanes (<a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">Air</a> / <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">Land</a>): Obtain a valid Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) <b>at least 3 days before </b>planned arrival. <br><br> To be eligible for the VTLs, the traveller must only have travel history to Singapore, <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process#countries" target="_blank">VTL countries</a> or <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank"> Category I countries/regions</a>, can only arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL flight/bus, and must satisfy all conditions under the VTL (Air / Land).</li>
  <p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:10px;"><b>OR</b></p>
  <li style="line-height:1.5;">Under the <a href="/stpl/overview" target="_blank">Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)</a>: Obtain a valid entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) at least 2 weeks before your planned arrival. Applications can be made <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO1/STPHL" target="_blank">here</a>.<br/><br/>The STP/STP-IPA holder will be subject to the prevailing Stay-Home Notice (SHN) <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">requirements</a>. <br/><br/> Please also note that all payments made for entry applications under the STPHL are <b>non-refundable</b>, and also <b>cannot be transferred</b> to offset payments required under the VTL </li>
  </ol> 
  
STP/STP-IPA holders who do not fulfil the requirements of the respective travel lanes on arrival will be denied entry into Singapore.

#### 10. Do I still need to obtain an entry approval under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) if I want to enter Singapore under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)?

No, you are not required to apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the STPHL if you are travelling via the VTL. If you are travelling via the VTL, you will need to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) instead. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a> and <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a>.


#### 11. I am travelling from a country that Singapore has established a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) with. I have previously obtained an entry approval under the Student's Pass Holder Lane (STPHL). Will I still be required to serve the 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

If you enter Singapore using the entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) obtained under the STPHL, you will need to fulfill the prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category II travel and health control measures</a>, including serving a 7-day SHN at a self-sourced accommodation.

If you wish to enter Singapore without having to serve SHN, you will need to obtain a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) under the Vaccinated Travel Lane. You must also enter Singapore on a designated VTL flight or bus service. For more information, please refer to the webpages for the <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process" target="_blank">VTL (Air)</a> and <a href="/vtl-land/overview" target="_blank">VTL (Land)</a>.

Please also note that payments made for the entry application under the STPHL are non-refundable, and also cannot be transferred to offset payments required under the VTL. However, if you obtained your entry approval under the STPHL before the announcement of the VTL, and later enter Singapore under the VTL, you may be eligible for a refund.

#### 12. Can I apply for both an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL) and a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)?

You may apply for both a SafeTravel Pass under the STPHL and a VTP under the VTL for the same travel period. However, please note that if you had applied for the SafeTravel Pass after the announcement of the VTL, the fees you have paid under the STPHL will be non-refundable, and also cannot be transferred to offset payments required under the VTL. 


#### 13. If I am unable to secure a seat on a designated flight under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL), can I apply for an entry approval (“SafeTravel Pass”) under the Student’s Pass Holder Lane (STPHL)?

Yes, you may apply for an entry approval under the STPHL. However, this must be done <b>at least two weeks before your intended period of travel</b>. Appeals for travel periods that not available on the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO1/STPHL" target="_blank">STPHL application portal</a> will not be accepted. 
Travellers who enter under the STPHL will be subject to the prevailing <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">border measures</a>, including having to serve a Stay-Home Notice.
