Travellers who are fully vaccinated and are returning from Brunei and Germany from <b>8 Sep 2021</b> onwards, should refer to the [Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL)](/vtl/requirements-and-process) for more information.

STP holders who are related to a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident (SC/PR), e.g. family member, relative or fiancé/fiancée, should apply for entry via the <a href="/scpr-familial-ties-lane/overview">SC/PR Familial Ties Lane</a>. Foreign students holding a Dependent’s Pass and family members holding MOM-issued passes should apply for entry via the <a href="/wphl/overview">Work Pass Holder General Lane</a>.

Travellers should refer to the indicative travel health control measures (<a href="/stpl/shn-and-swab-summary">here</a>) which are imposed based on their 21-day travel history to various countries/regions, before arriving in Singapore.

All travellers are required to take a PDT before arrival in Singapore, except those who:

Travellers are required to take their PDT at an [accredited or authorised testing facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country/region of departure and ensure that the PDT:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</li>

<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.</li>
</ol>

B) <u>Submission of Declarations &amp; Registration for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test</u>

Travellers who are fit for travel must:

<div id="SGAC"></div>

<ol style="padding-left:30px; margin-top:25px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:25px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Submit an SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/">here</a></li>

</ol>

Travellers should also activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a>, <a href="https://www.homer.gov.sg/">Homer</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download">WhatsApp</a> mobile applications in their mobile phones. These applications are necessary to facilitate SHN compliance checks and contact tracing.

C) <u>Application for Entry Visas</u>

Valid entry-visa holders and visa-exempted travellers are not required to apply for an entry visa to enter Singapore. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa, or wish to apply for a visa may <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements">click here</a> for more information.

### 2. Departure for Singapore

Travellers must obtain a valid entry approval letter before travelling to Singapore. During pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked to produce the approval letter.

Travellers who have visited any high-risk country/region in the past 21 days before departure for Singapore, must also present a valid negative PDT report during pre-boarding checks, otherwise they may be denied boarding. Click <a href="/stpl/shn-and-swab-summary">here</a> to check if a PDT is required.

### 3. Arrival in Singapore

A) <u>Immigration Clearance</u>

Travellers who arrive in Singapore without a <a href="#PDT">valid negative PDT report</a> may be denied entry into Singapore and could have their passes revoked.

Depending on the traveller’s 21-day travel history, they will receive their SHN via the email provided in the <a href="#SGAC">SGAC declaration</a>. Travellers who have visited multiple countries/regions in the past 21 days before entering Singapore, will be subject to the strictest set of travel health control measures. Travellers who do not receive an SHN will be required to remain in self-isolation until a negative COVID-19 PCR test result is conveyed.

B) <u>COVID-19 Tests</u>

Travellers must take their on-arrival COVID-19 test(s) and commute directly to their self-isolation accommodation or SDF immediately. Travellers who did not <a href="#SGAC">pay for their test(s) before arrival</a>, will pay on the spot.

C) <u>Transport to Self-Isolation/SHN accommodation</u>

Travellers are prohibited from using public transport (i.e. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) to commute to their self-isolation/SHN accommodation or SDF. Depending on the traveller’s SHN arrangement, they have the following transport options, which will apply throughout the SHN period:

### 4. Self-isolation, Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

Travellers must remain in their accommodation of self-isolation or SHN/SDF, until <u>after</u> they are ascertained to be free of COVID-19.

All SHN-serving travellers are required to take additional COVID-19 tests during the SHN period. Depending on the volume of tests conducted that day, the result of the COVID-19 PCR test is generally released to the traveller after about 24 hours from when the test was administered. The result could be conveyed to the traveller via a call, SMS or email. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices">HealthHub App</a>. Any traveller who is tested positive for <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-symptoms">COVID-19</a> will be <a href="/health/covidtreatment">sent for treatment</a> immediately. 

Click <a href="/stpl/shn-and-swab-summary">here</a> to check for the tests required and automatically scheduled for you during your SHN. Otherwise, refer to the table below for the typical test schedule.

### 5. Completion of Self-isolation/SHN

Travellers under self-isolation or serving SHN at their own residence may leave their accommodation after a negative COVID-19 test result is conveyed. For travellers serving SHN at an SDF, the checkout timing would be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF.

Travellers must comply with the prevailing public health-related and safe distancing measures. This includes the use of the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> app, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
