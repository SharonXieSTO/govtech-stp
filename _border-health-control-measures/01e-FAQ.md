## **Border and Health Control Measures**

FAQs on border and health control measures can be found on ICA's website <a href="https://va.ecitizen.gov.sg/cfp/customerpages/ICA/explorefaq.aspx?Category=75054" target="_blank">here</a>.

## **Pre-Departure Test for travellers travelling to Singapore** 

#### 1. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. Do I need to take a pre-departure test before travelling to Singapore? 

Travellers who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents and who are required to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN), will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure. Travellers will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result in order to board the flight and at immigration in Singapore. 

This pre-departure test requirement does not apply to travellers who have remained in the low risk countries/regions – Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong[1], Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Vietnam – in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry into Singapore. Please click [here](/health) for the latest measures.

#### 2.	I am transiting via Singapore. Do I still need to have a valid negative COVID-19 test result?

At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transit through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer route has been approved. Travellers are encouraged to confirm with their airlines on their eligibility to travel. 

Currently, only travellers from India / Indonesia / the Philippines who are transiting through Singapore (i.e. India via Singapore to destination country) will have to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result. 

#### 3. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. What kind of COVID-19 tests will be accepted? 

Singapore only accepts test results from [labs](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country that are internationally accredited or recognised by the respective Government. The test result memo must state the negative test result in English, date that the test was taken, traveller/s name and either Date of Birth or Passport Number as stated in the passport, If the personal details used are not stated in the passport, the traveller should have the relevant identity document on hand for verification. 

#### 4. I have an upcoming flight to Singapore. When must my pre-departure test (PDT) be taken before the flight to be accepted for arrival in Singapore?

Inbound travellers, who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and who are required to serve a 14-day SHN, must take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure in order to enter Singapore. 

**Direct flight**

For travellers who take a direct flight, the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the flight to Singapore.

**Connecting flights**

For travellers who have to take a connecting flight(s), the 72 hours will be counted from the departure of the first leg only and the total transit duration for the trip must not be more than 24 hours. If the total transit duration is more than 24 hours, a PDT must be taken within 72 hours from the last leg (i.e. the flight to Singapore).  

For negative test result requirements, please refer to **question 3**.

Travellers on stipulated COVID-19 travel channels (e.g. Green/Fast Lane arrangements, or designated Air Travel Bubble (ATB) flights from Hong Kong) are required to comply with prevailing border health conditions stipulated as part of their entry permits. 

#### 5.	I am travelling with my child. Will my child be required to undergo a pre-departure test before entry into Singapore?
#### 6.	Are children and infants exempted from the pre-departure test?

All travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents), including children aged 12 and below, who are required to serve a 14-day SHN will be required to present a valid negative COVID-19 test result as a condition of entry into Singapore. 

There is no exemption for children and infants. 

#### 7.	Are returning travellers to Singapore on the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGLs) subjected to the PDT before return to Singapore?

Please click [here](/arriving/overview) to find out more on the Reciprocal Green Lane arrangements.  

#### 8.	I have recovered from COVID-19, am I required to undergo a pre-departure test before entry into Singapore? Will I be denied entry into Singapore?

Individuals who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection will still be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before departure for Singapore. 

If the pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result is positive, the recovered individual must also submit documentary proof of his/her past diagnosis of COVID-19, based on his/her first ever positive PCR test result. The date of the first ever positive PCR test result must be between 22 to 180 days prior to the date of arrival in Singapore. 

Please note that individuals will be denied boarding for flights bound for Singapore if they have a recent diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the past 21 days. 

#### 9.	What will happen if I arrive in Singapore and do not have a valid negative PCR test certificate?

Travellers (who are not Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) from countries where a valid negative COVID-19 test result is required as a condition for entry into Singapore, but are unable to produce a valid negative COVID-19 test result, will be denied entry into Singapore. 

Airlines, Charterers and Air Operators for any flights to Singapore must conduct checks to ensure that passengers meet the requirement before they are allowed for boarding. Air operators will be responsible to repatriate any passenger rejected at the checkpoint. 

If passengers are found to have produced false/forged COVID-19 test certificates, it will affect their ability to obtain or sponsor immigration facilities in the future.
