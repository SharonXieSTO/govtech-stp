### 5) Designated VTL Transport


#### 1. Are travellers guaranteed a ticket on a designated VTL flight/bus/ferry to Singapore if they have a VTP?

Having a VTP does not guarantee travellers a ticket on a designated VTL (Air) flight/ VTL (Land) bus/ VTL (Sea) ferry to Singapore. Travellers are responsible for obtaining their own tickets. Similarly, having a ticket on a designated VTL (Air)/VTL (Land)/VTL (Sea) flight to Singapore does not guarantee a VTP.

#### 2. I have a VTP and I meet all the requirements under the VTL, except that I only managed to book a non-VTL transport service. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore under quarantine-free VTL terms?

As required under the VTL (Air) <a href="/vtl/conditions" target="_blank">Conditions</a>/ VTL (Land) <a href="/vtl-land/conditions" target="_blank">Conditions</a>/ VTL (Sea) <a href="/vtl-sea/conditions" target="_blank">Conditions</a>,  a VTP holder must arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL transport in order to be eligible for quarantine-free VTL measures. They should approach the transport operator for assistance to rebook a ticket on a designated VTL flight/bus/ferry if possible.

Travellers who are not Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents may be turned away by the transport providers if they do not meet the necessary entry requirements to Singapore for non-VTL lanes (e.g. vaccination requirements under Work Pass Holder Lane). Please check the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore page</a> for non-VTL lanes that fit your profile, and read the entry requirements of the non-VTL lanes.


#### 3. I have a VTP and I meet all the requirements under the VTL (Land). However, I did not manage to get a ticket on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore if I drive my private vehicle, cycle, walk or take a non-designated bus service?

As required under the <a href="/vtl-land/conditions" target="_blank">VTL (Land) conditions</a>, a VTP holder must arrive in Singapore on a designated VTL (Land) bus service. All travellers who do not arrive on a designated VTL (Land) bus service to Singapore may be denied entry into Singapore and/or subjected to prevailing border measures.

#### 4. Where are the boarding and disembarkation points for VTL (Land) bus services from Malaysia to Singapore, and from Singapore to Malaysia?

Travellers entering Singapore under the VTL (Land) will have to board the bus at Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. The bus will arrive at Queen Street Terminal (for Handal Indah bus service) or Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange (for Transtar Travel bus service) in Singapore, via the Causeway. (<i>Note: From 21 February 2021, 2359 hours, travellers entering under the VTL (Land) will not be required to reboard the bus after immigration clearance and may choose to disembark from Woodlands Checkpoint</i>.)

Travellers entering Malaysia under the VTL (Land) will have to board the bus at Queen Street Terminal (for Handal Indah bus service) or Woodlands Temporary Bus Interchange (for Transtar Travel bus service) in Singapore. The bus will arrive at Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, via the Causeway. 

#### 5. What should travellers do if they are ineligible for the VTL, but had booked themselves onto a designated VTL flight/bus/ferry?

They should approach the airline/bus operator/regional ferry operator for assistance to rebook a ticket on a non-designated VTL flight/bus/ferry.

#### 6. Do travellers need a return flight/bus/ferry ticket to enter Singapore?

Short term visitor travellers under VTL (Sea) require a return ferry ticket to enter Singapore. 

All other travellers under the VTL (Air)/VTL (Land)/VTL (Sea) do not need a return flight/bus/ferry ticket to enter Singapore. 

#### 7. Can transfer/transit passengers travel on designated VTL (Air) flights?

Transfer/transit passengers who are <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> with WHO EUL vaccines may travel on designated VTL (Air) flights, regardless of where they were issued their vaccination certificate and regardless of their travel history, as long as they are able to show proof of vaccination.

Please check the <a href="/transit/overview" target="_blank">Transiting through Singapore</a> page for more details.

Fully vaccinated recently-recovered travellers entering Singapore may qualify for exemption from the post-arrival COVID-19 ARTs. Please refer to <a href="/vaccinated-recovered" target="_blank">this page</a> for more information.</span></i></p>






#### 1. What should travellers do if they test positive for COVID-19 on any of their ARTs?

This will be provided free-of-charge. They do not need to attend or perform their scheduled ART if it falls on the same day as their PCR test, but should remain contactable via their declared mobile number and email address.

Travellers should take private transport, taxi or private hire car to the CTC, and return to their place of accommodation immediately after their test. Use of public transport is not allowed. If they were planning to depart from Singapore, they should defer their travel plans, attend their confirmatory PCR test, and await their PCR test results. They should not leave their place of accommodation other than to undergo the PCR test and until their PCR test result is confirmed to be negative.-->

Their self-administered and self-declared ARTs results may also be used to fulfil any HRW testing requirements, and they are required to upload their ARTs results on both the website for the submission of unsupervised self-administered ART results (specified in the Legal Notice issued upon arrival), as well as the website specified in the HRW.


#### 4. Do travellers need to undergo post-arrival ARTs if they will be going onboard a "Cruise to Nowhere"?

### (g) Additional Requirements for Short-Term Visitors

### (i) Visa Application

<div id="visa"></div>

#### 1. Do visitors with a valid VTP (Air) need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa to enter Singapore, must separately obtain a visa. They are advised to do so after receiving their VTP (Air) approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.

Visitors may refer to ICA’s website <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements">here</a> for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Please note that the VTP (Air) is <u><b>not</b></u> an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend">here</a> at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.

### (ii) Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance Coverage

#### 1. Why is there a need for visitors to purchase COVID-19 travel insurance?

This is to ensure that short-term visitors will be able to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Those who test positive for COVID-19 typically receive care in private hospitals.

#### 2. What is the minimum coverage for COVID-19 travel insurance?

Visitors must purchase travel insurance for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travelling to Singapore. Should their COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond S$30,000, visitors will have to pay for the excess.

#### 3. Do visitors need to show proof of travel insurance purchase when they apply for the VTP (Air)?

Visitors will have to declare, at the point of VTP (Air) application, that they will purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travelling to Singapore. They must also carry with them an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to facilitate their entry into Singapore.

#### 4. What penalties will be imposed on the visitor if he/she did not buy the insurance prior to entering Singapore?

Purchase of travel insurance is a condition of the VTL (Air). Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the VTL (Air) may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the VTP (Air) and/or Visit Pass. In such an event, the VTP (Air) holder may be repatriated, and be liable for the cost of his/her repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future VTP applications may also be rejected.

### Application for the Vaccinated Travel Pass (Air) [VTP (Air)]

<p style="font-size:16px; color:red;line-height:1.5;"><i>Note: Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and unvaccinated children aged 12 and below in this calendar year are not required to apply for a VTP (Air). However they must comply with all other VTL <a href="/vtl/conditions">conditions</a>.</i></p>

#### 1. How long will it take for a VTP (Air) application to be processed?

All travellers who successfully submit their application will be issued with a VTP (Air) immediately.

#### 2. Is there a fee to apply for a VTP (Air)?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of a VTP (Air).  

#### 3. Do travellers travelling with family members need to apply a VTP (Air) for every individual?

Yes, each traveller will require a VTP (Air).

#### 4. Is there a limit to the number of times travellers can apply for a VTP (Air)?

There is no limit to the number of times travellers can apply for a VTP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new VTP (Air) application.

#### 5. How long is the validity of a VTP (Air)?

A VTP (Air) is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the traveller’s intended date of entry and up to 13 calendar days after.

For example, travellers who hold a valid VTP (Air) to enter Singapore on 1 March 2022, have up to 14 March 2022 to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 6. Once a VTP (Air) application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the VTL (Air) conditions or even cancel the VTP (Air)?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. This may result in changes to the VTP (Air) conditions or cancellation of the VTP (Air) at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their VTP (Air).

#### 7. Do Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents need to apply for an VTP (Air)?

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do <u>not</u> need to apply for a VTP to travel to Singapore under the VTL, as they can return to Singapore without the need for entry approval provided they adhere to the VTL requirements. Please click <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process">here</a> for more information on the requirements.

#### 8. I have an In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a Long-Term Pass. How should I apply for the VTP (Air)?

Travellers with IPA for Long-Term Passes issued by the Ministry of Education (MOE) or the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) should submit their VTP (Air) application under the ‘Short-Term Visitor’ traveller type. They will need to comply with all the <A href="/vtl/conditions" target="_blank">conditions</a> of the VTP (Air) that apply to short-term visitors.

Those with IPA for Long-Term Passes or a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) should submit their VTP (Air) application under the ‘Singapore Long-Term Pass Holder’ traveller type.

	
#### 9. Why was I unsuccessful in applying for a VTP (Air)?
	
A VTP application may be unsuccessful for reasons such as:
- <a href="/vtl/faq#invalidcode" target="_blank">Invalid vaccination QR code</a>
- Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
- Passport validity is less than 6 months


#### 10. I have made a booking on a designated VTL (Air) flight and meet the requirements under VTL (Air). However, I am unable to obtain a VTP (Air) for my intended date of entry. Can I still travel to Singapore under the VTL (Air) on the designated VTL flight? 

Short-Term Visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders must obtain a VTP (Air) to travel to Singapore under the VTL (Air), even if they meet the conditions of the VTL (Air). They will not be allowed to board a designated VTL (Air) flight if they are unable to present a valid VTP (Air).

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do not need to apply for a VTP (Air) to travel to Singapore under the VTL (Air), as they can return to Singapore on a VTL (Air) flight without the need for entry approval, provided they meet the VTL (Air) conditions.

 
#### 11. How do I change the validity of my VTP (Air)?

A VTP (Air) is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from your intended date of entry and up to 13 calendar days after.
If your travel plans change and you need to enter before or after the validity period, please submit a new VTP (Air) application. 

Should you require assistance to seek urgent entry into Singapore within the next 2 days, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form [here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry) or call the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at 6812 5555. Kindly note that all appeals are assessed on a case-by-case basis. 

#### 12. How do I change my declared particulars (e.g. mobile number, email address, self-isolation accommodation) on my VTP (Air) application?

If your particulars have changed, please write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry">here</a> with your revised particulars.

#### 13. How can I change my passport number on my VTP (Air)?

You will not be able to change the passport number on an existing VTP (Air). Please submit a new application with the correct details reflected. Do note that travellers with an inaccurate passport number on their VTP (Air) may be denied boarding and entry into Singapore.

If your intended date of entry is no longer available on the VTP (Air) application portal, please adjust your travel plans. You will not be allowed to board a designated VTL (Air) flight if you are unable to present a valid VTP (Air).


#### 14. How can I cancel my VTP (Air) as I no longer wish to travel to Singapore?

You do not need to cancel your VTP (Air). If you do not utilise your VTP (Air) within the validity period, it will automatically expire.


#### 15. Can travellers use the VTP (Air) to transit/transfer through Singapore?

No, the VTP (Air) is for travellers who intend to enter Singapore and is not applicable for transfer/transit passengers. At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transfer through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer routes have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Travellers should confirm with their airline on their eligibility to transfer.
