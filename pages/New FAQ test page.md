#### 8. What should travellers do if they intend to travel to Singapore under VTL, but had booked themselves onto a non-designated flight? 

They should approach the airline for assistance to rebook a ticket on a designated VTL flight. 

#### 9. What should travellers do if they are ineligible for the VTL, but had booked themselves onto a designated VTL flight? 

They should approach the airline for assistance to rebook a ticket on a non-designated VTL flight. 

#### 10. I have an EU Digital COVID Certificate (EU DCC) issued in a non-VTL (Air) country/region. Can I transit via a VTL country/region and take a designated VTL flight to Singapore? 

No, you will not be allowed to board the designated VTL flight, as your would have had travel history to a non-VTL (Air) and non-Category I country/region.

Travellers with EU DCCs issued in any European Union Member States or non-EU countries that have joined the EU DCC system may seek entry into Singapore under the VTL (Air). However, they must continue to fulfil all <a href="/vtl/conditions" target="_blank">VTL (Air) conditions</a>. 

#### 11. Do travellers need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore?

Travellers under the VTL (Air) do not need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore. However, they are advised to check with the relevant authorities on the entry requirements of the country/region to which they are travelling after Singapore.

#### 12. Are travellers required to take designated VTL flights to depart from Singapore?

No, the VTL (Air) is meant for travellers who intend to seek entry into Singapore. For travellers flying departing from Singapore, it will depend on the inbound requirements of the destination country/region. Currently, there are no requirements for designated VTL (Air) flights.

#### 13. Can transfer/transit passengers travel on designated VTL (Air) flights?

Transfer/transit passengers who are <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> with WHO EUL vaccines may travel on designated VTL (Air) flights, regardless of where they were issued their vaccination certificate and regardless of their travel history, as long as they are able to show proof of vaccination.

At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transfer through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer routes have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). They are required to be through-checked to their onward destination, as they will not be allowed to clear arrival immigration. Travellers should confirm with their airline on their eligibility to transfer.

Please also note that if a traveller’s test result is confirmed to be positive, all persons who had shared the same room with the traveller, as well as those identified to be a close contact, may be served with a Health Risk Warning (HRW).
 
VTL (Air) travellers issued a HRW after being identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case are still required to comply with the post-arrival testing requirements, in addition to the requirements of the HRW.  Their self-administered and self-declared ARTs results may also be used to fulfil any HRW testing requirements, and they are required to upload their ARTs results on both the website for the submission of unsupervised self-administered ART results (specified in the Legal Notice issued upon arrival), as well as the website specified in the HRW.

Supervised self-administered COVID-19 ARTs must be performed at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/QTC-ART-testing" target="_blank">Quick Test Centres (QTCs) or Combined Test Centres (CTCs)</a>. Unsupervised self-administered COVID-19 ARTs can be performed at one’s place of accommodation using <a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_selftests" target="_blank">self-procured ART kits</a>.-->

#### 1. Are children required to undergo post-arrival ARTs?

Children aged 2 and below in this calendar year are not required to undergo post-arrival ARTs.


#### 2. What should travellers do if they test positive for COVID-19 on any of their ARTs?

<!--Travellers who test positive for any of their supervised or unsupervised ARTs must self-isolate immediately, book an appointment for a confirmatory PCR test at a <a href="https://go.gov.sg/QTC-ART-testing" target="_blank">Combined Test Centre (CTC)</a> via the booking link provided as soon as possible and undergo the PCR test no later than 1600 hours on the day after testing ART positive. This will be provided free-of-charge. They do not need to attend or perform their scheduled ART if it falls on the same day as their PCR test, but should remain contactable via their declared mobile number and email address.

Travellers should take private transport, taxi or private hire car to the CTC, and return to their place of accommodation immediately after their test. Use of public transport is not allowed. If they were planning to depart from Singapore, they should defer their travel plans, attend their confirmatory PCR test, and await their PCR test results. They should not leave their place of accommodation other than to undergo the PCR test and until their PCR test result is confirmed to be negative.-->

Travellers who test positive on the unsupervised self-administered ARTs will no longer need to undergo a confirmatory PCR test. Should you test positive, you must abide by the relevant COVID-19 recovery protocol immediately. You may refer to <a href="https://www.covid.gov.sg/well-and-positive-or-condition-assessed-mild-by-doctor" target="_blank"> this link</a> for more details on Protocol 2. You should self-isolate for 72 hours at your place of accommodation, which will allow you to safely recover, monitor your health and avoid spreading the virus further. If you were planning to depart from Singapore, you are required to defer your travel plans until you complete self-isolation and obtain a negative ART result. For more information on what to do if you feel unwell while in Singapore, please refer to <a href="https://www.covid.gov.sg/travellers" target="_blank"> this link</a>.

Failure to do so may constitute an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act (IDA). A traveller who fails to undergo the required COVID-19 tests may also be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) / Stay Order.


#### 3. Are travellers who are issued with a Health Risk Warning (HRW) still required to comply with the VTL (Air) post-arrival testing regime?

VTL (Air) travellers issued a HRW after being identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case are still required to comply with the post-arrival ART testing requirements, in addition to the requirements of the HRW.  Their self-administered and self-declared ARTs results may also be used to fulfil any HRW testing requirements, and they are required to upload their ARTs results on both the website for the submission of unsupervised self-administered ART results (specified in the Legal Notice issued upon arrival), as well as the website specified in the HRW.


#### 4. Do travellers need to undergo post-arrival ARTs if they will be going onboard a "Cruise to Nowhere"?

### UNSUPERVISED ARTS

#### 5. Where can travellers obtain ART self-test kits?

Travellers may use their own self-test kits to administer their ART. If they do not have ART kits, they may either bring along a maximum of 20 <a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_selftests" target="_blank">ART kits authorised for use in Singapore</a> per individual from their country/region of departure, or purchase authorised ART kits from any local clinic, pharmacy, retailer or e-commerce platform. ART kits will not be provided upon arrival. 

If travellers are serving their self-isolation pending their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test results, they may obtain ART kits via applications such as Grab and foodpanda which offer 24/7 delivery. Those residing in hotels can also seek their hotel concierge’s assistance to help them obtain ART kits.

They may only leave their place of accommodation after self-administering their ART.

#### 6. Are there specific ART kits that travellers may use for self-testing?

Travellers are advised to only purchase and use <a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/consumer-safety/articles/covid19_selftests" target="_blank">COVID-19 self-test kits authorised for use in Singapore</a> by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). As these tests are meant to be used by consumers, no doctor’s prescription is required for their purchase.

#### 7. How much does an ART kit cost?

ART kits typically cost less than S$15 and can be obtained from any local clinic, pharmacy, retailer or e-commerce platform.

#### 8. How do travellers self-administer an ART?

Travellers are strongly encouraged to <a href="https://artbuddy.healthpixel.co/" target="_blank">view the materials here</a> to learn how to self-administer an ART. They can follow the step-by-step instructions while administering their ART.

Travellers may also refer to <a href="https://www.covid.gov.sg/exposed/no-hrw" target="_blank">MOH's guidelines on COVID-19 self-testing</a> to ensure the correct use and appropriate follow-up actions based on the results of the self-testing. MOH’s simple guide to ART self-test kits is available in different languages at the following links:

#### 9. What time do travellers need to perform their ART?

Travellers are required to self-administer their ART before leaving their place of accommodation.

#### 10. How long will it take to obtain the results of the self-administered ART?

### (g) Additional Requirements for Short-Term Visitors

### (i) Visa Application

<div id="visa"></div>

#### 1. Do visitors with a valid VTP (Air) need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa to enter Singapore, must separately obtain a visa. They are advised to do so after receiving their VTP (Air) approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.

Visitors may refer to ICA’s website <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements">here</a> for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by the Singapore Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please note that the VTP (Air) is <u><b>not</b></u> an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend">here</a> at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.

<div id="insurance"></div>


### (ii) Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance Coverage

#### 1. Why is there a need for visitors to purchase COVID-19 travel insurance?

This is to ensure that short-term visitors will be able to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Those who test positive for COVID-19 typically receive care in private hospitals.

#### 2. What is the minimum coverage for COVID-19 travel insurance?

Visitors must purchase travel insurance for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travelling to Singapore. Should their COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond S$30,000, visitors will have to pay for the excess.

#### 3. Do visitors need to show proof of travel insurance purchase when they apply for the VTP (Air)?

Visitors will have to declare, at the point of VTP (Air) application, that they will purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travelling to Singapore. They must also carry with them an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to facilitate their entry into Singapore.

#### 4. What penalties will be imposed on the visitor if he/she did not buy the insurance prior to entering Singapore?

Purchase of travel insurance is a condition of the VTL (Air). Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the VTL (Air) may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the VTP (Air) and/or Visit Pass. In such an event, the VTP (Air) holder may be repatriated, and be liable for the cost of his/her repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future VTP applications may also be rejected.

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li><b>[For LTPH/STVs only]</b> upload your vaccination QR code in your VTP (Air) application (if required);</li>
	<li><b>[For SC/PRs only]</b> upload your vaccination certificate on your SG Arrival Card submission; or </li>
<li>present your overseas vaccination certificate at the immigration counter on-arrival.</li>
	</ol>

Thereafter, your vaccination status will expire. For your vaccination status to be permanently valid, you will need to present your overseas vaccination certificate and undergo a serology test at participating clinics in Singapore. Please call the clinic prior to your visit, to confirm that they provide such services.

#### 7. Do Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents need to apply for an VTP (Air)?

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do <u>not</u> need to apply for a VTP to travel to Singapore under the VTL, as they can return to Singapore without the need for entry approval provided they adhere to the VTL requirements.

#### 8. I have an In-Principle Approval (IPA) for a Long-Term Pass. How should I apply for the VTP (Air)?

They will need to comply with all the <A href="/vtl/conditions" target="_blank">conditions</a> of the VTP (Air) that apply to short-term visitors.

Those with IPA for Long-Term Passes or a Long-Term Visit Pass (LTVP) issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) should submit their VTP (Air) application under the ‘Singapore Long-Term Pass Holder’ traveller type.

	
#### 9. Why was I unsuccessful in applying for a VTP (Air)?

#### 10. I have made a booking on a designated VTL (Air) flight and meet the requirements under VTL (Air). However, I am unable to obtain a VTP (Air) for my intended date of entry. Can I still travel to Singapore under the VTL (Air) on the designated VTL flight? 

Short-Term Visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders must obtain a VTP (Air) to travel to Singapore under the VTL (Air), even if they meet the conditions of the VTL (Air). They will not be allowed to board a designated VTL (Air) flight if they are unable to present a valid VTP (Air).

Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do not need to apply for a VTP (Air) to travel to Singapore under the VTL (Air), as they can return to Singapore on a VTL (Air) flight without the need for entry approval, provided they meet the VTL (Air) conditions.

 
#### 11. How do I change the validity of my VTP (Air)?

A VTP (Air) is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from your intended date of entry and up to 13 calendar days after.

#### 14. How can I cancel my VTP (Air) as I no longer wish to travel to Singapore?
