## Instructions Before Use 

Travellers entering Singapore via the following travel lanes/arrangements and are aware of their <a href="/health/shn" target="_blank">Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</a> duration may use these calculators to obtain the indicative (a) exit from SHN COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test date, and (b) SHN end date. 
- Returning Singapore Citizen / Permanent Resident Lane
- Familial Ties Lane
- Periodic Commuting Arrangement 
- Student's Pass Holder Lane
- Work Pass Holder General Lane

If you are unsure which lane you will be using to enter Singapore, return to the "<a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">Travelling to Singapore</a>" page for help.

These calculators <u><b>cannot</b></u> provide a definitive SHN end date/time as these are determined based on the traveller's exit-from-SHN test result. Results are conveyed via call, SMS or email. Only travellers who test negative for their compulsory exit-from-SHN PCR test, or have completed the required SHN period, whichever is later, are permitted to leave their SHN accommodation. Travellers serving their SHN at an <a href="/health/shn/sdf" target="_blank">SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)</a> will be informed of their check-out time by the SDF operator, who would receive the traveller's exit-from-SHN result from the relevant government agencies.
