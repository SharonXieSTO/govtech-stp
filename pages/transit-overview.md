#### Eligibility

Only passengers travelling with an airline whose transfer route via Singapore has been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will be allowed to transit/transfer at Singaporeâ€™s Changi Airport. <u>Travellers are advised to confirm arrangements with the airlines they intend to fly with before purchasing their flight tickets</u>. You can also visit the Changi Airport website for more information on <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/Covid-19/transiting-through-airport.html" target="_blank">transiting through Singapore</a>.

<b>With effect from 12 July 2021, 2359 hours, <u>all travellers</u></b> with travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days will not be allowed to transit through Singapore.

#### Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test

From <b>29 May 2021, 2359 hours, <u>all</u> travellers transiting through Singapore (<u>including Singapore Citizens and PRs</u>) via flight or ferry</b> will need to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure before they are allowed to board their flight or ferry for travel to Singapore.

<u>Exemptions</u>:  Travellers who only had travel history to Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Mainland China, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Macao in the past 21 days before departing to Singapore to transit are exempted from this Pre-Departure Test requirement.


#### Entry Visas

Foreign travellers transiting in Singapore will not require entry visas if they can complete their transit by staying within the transit area of Changi Airport (Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 4) without clearing immigration.

Some airlines may require travellers to pass through Singapore Immigration to transit as they do not have the necessary transfer facilities in the transit area of the airport. In such cases, the traveller should check the ICA main website <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements">here</a> on whether they need to apply for an entry visa.

Please check with your airline if you are unsure which of the scenarios above apply to you.
