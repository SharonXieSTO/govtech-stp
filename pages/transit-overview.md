### Transiting Through Singapore

Travellers will gradually be allowed to transit through Changi Airport. This is part of Singapore's strategy to gradually re-open air transport to meet the needs of our economy and our people, whilst ensuring sufficient safeguards for safe travel.

Only passengers travelling with an airline whose transfer route has been approved will be allowed to transit/transfer at Singapore’s Changi Airport. Travellers are advised to confirm arrangements with airlines they intend to fly with before purchasing their flight tickets. More information on transiting through Singapore can be found on Changi Airport’s [website](https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/Covid-19/transiting-through-airport.html).
