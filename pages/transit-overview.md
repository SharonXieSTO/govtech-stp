### Overview

#### Eligibility

Only passengers travelling with an airline whose transfer route via Singapore has been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will be allowed to transit/transfer at Singaporeâ€™s Changi Airport. <u>Travellers are advised to confirm arrangements with the airlines they intend to fly with before purchasing their flight tickets</u>. You can also visit the Changi Airport website for more information on <a href="https://www.changiairport.com/en/airport-guide/Covid-19/transiting-through-airport.html" target="_blank">transiting through Singapore</a>.

#### Entry Visas

Foreign travellers transiting in Singapore will not require entry visas if they can complete their transit by staying within the transit area of Changi Airport (Terminals 1, 2, 3 and 4) without clearing immigration.

Some airlines may require travellers to pass through Singapore Immigration to transit as they do not have the necessary transfer facilities in the airport. In such cases, the traveller should check the ICA main website <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements">here</a> on whether they need to apply for an entry visa.

Please check with your airline if you are unsure which of the scenarios above apply to you.
