&#9744;  <i><b>D) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit their pre-trip health and travel history declaration via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</a>.

All SCAG submissions are free-of-charge, and <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated travellers</a> should also upload their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate if they have one, i.e. certificate with a QR code. Upon verification, the travellers’ vaccination status will be reflected in HealthHub or the TraceTogether application for 30 days, which can be used in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moh-smm" target="_blank">vaccination-differentiated settings</a>.

Travellers should <b>defer their travels</b> if they:

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Are showing COVID-19 symptoms</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Are diagnosed or suspected to have contracted COVID-19 in the last 14 days before departing for Singapore; or</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Had been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient in the last 7 days before departing for Singapore.

</ol>


<div id="stage1e"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Registration and Pre-payment for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test [only for arrivals before 3 Jan 2022, 2359h]</b></i>

Travellers who are fit for travel should <a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/" target="_blank">register and pay</a> for the on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (S$125) required of those aged 3 and above this calendar year. Without advance booking, travellers can expect delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>F) Installation of TraceTogether app</b></i>

Travellers must install and activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> mobile application on their mobile phones for contact tracing. Travellers aged 6 or below in this calendar year, and individuals who are unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability/special need can obtain a <a href="/health/tt-for-travellers" target="_blank">TraceTogether token</a> after arrival in Singapore.

&#9744;  <i><b>G) Secure Accommodation for Stay-Home Notice</b></i>

Travellers are required to remain in self-isolation at a declared accommodation until they receive a negative COVID-19 test result, which includes:

- Place of residence; or
- Hotel of choice from this <a href="https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation" target="_blank">non-exhaustive list</a>. 

For hotel bookings, travellers should check and ensure that the hotel can accommodate self-isolating guests waiting for their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test ("PCR Test") result before a booking is made. During booking, they should indicate that they are serving self-isolation for the on-arrival test.

Travellers may serve SHN at their residence with other household members, regardless of their household members' vaccination status or travel history. However, the following precautions are strongly advised:  
	<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-latin;">
	<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Isolate in their own room during the 7-day period;</li>
	<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Minimise contact with any household members and avoid sharing bathrooms. If bathroom sharing cannot be avoided, all members in the household should:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
	<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Lower the lid before flushing the toilet;</li>
		<li style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.5;">Clean and disinfect contact surfaces after each use; and</li>
		<li style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.5;">Avoid using the toilet after the self-isolating individual for at least 20 minutes.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	</ol>


### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and
- Valid Pre-Departure test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result (see [Stage 1C](#stage1c))

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

During immigration clearance, provide all relevant documents and information required by the immigration officer, including proof of tests taken if necessary. 

<b>Eligible travellers vaccinated overseas should also inform the immigration officer to temporarily register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether app</b>, in order to be eligible for vaccination-differentiated measures within Singapore (e.g. visiting malls, dining out). Travellers staying longer than 30 days will need to take a serology test to extend their vaccination status. <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">Click here for more details on the eligibility criteria and procedure for registering vaccination status</a>. 

For visitors granted entry, please note that <b>all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore via air will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) and period of stay granted through email</b>. There will not be any physical endorsement on the visitor's passport unless arriving by land or sea. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">Click here for more information about the e-Pass</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) On arrival COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test at Changi Airport. Travellers are required to <a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/" target="_blank">book and pre-pay</a> for the test before arrival. Without advance booking, travellers can expect delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card" target="_blank">SGAC declaration</a>. The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

&#9744; <i><b>D) Transport to Declared Self-Isolation Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers with 14-day travel history to only Category (I) or (II) countries/regions will be able to commute using their own private transport, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL Tada). 

Travellers must rely on the same transport option when commuting from their SHN accommodation to the testing facility for the exit-SHN COVID-19 PCR test on the last day of SHN. 

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses) is strictly prohibited. 

### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers **must** remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, **unless** they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken before the end of the SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">here</a> for an SHN calculator. Travellers may complete their SHN at their own residence (see advisory below), self-sourced hotel, or serviced apartment. Travellers planning to serve their SHN at a self-sourced hotel must inform the hotel that they are serving a SHN and ensure that the hotel can accommodate them, before securing their bookings. Travellers may refer to this page for the <a href="https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation" target="_blank">non-exhaustive list of hotels</a> offering SHN-accommodation.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. <a href="/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks" target="_blank">Click here for more information on SHN-related compliance matters</a>.



&#9744;  <i><b>B) End-of-SHN COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) before the end of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. 

The test costs SGD$125 (including GST). Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will be advised on payment details after arrival. All other travellers would have paid for the test at the point of entry application.

### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

Travellers may end their SHN arrangements upon receipt of a negative test result or when they complete the 7-day SHN period, whichever is later. The result of the test will be communicated via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the  <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>. 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/insurance-and-treatment#treatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> 

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, <a href="/health/vtsg#VDSMM" target="_blank">click here to check how to get your vaccinated status recognised in Singapore.</a> 

Travellers should also use the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
