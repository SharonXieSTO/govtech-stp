  <h4>You have reached this holding page as there is a high number of users currently using the SafeTravel application portal.</h4>

  <p>If you are applying for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (Land) [VTP(Land)], please note that there is no quota for applications and there is no need to rush to apply. You should secure tickets for designated Vaccinated Travel Lane (Land) transport first as those are limited. Applications for VTP (Land) are currently only open for those entering Singapore from 29 Nov to 5 Dec 2021, travellers who are entering after these dates should apply on another day. Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do not need to apply for a VTP.</p>
	  <p>If you intend to proceed with an application, please try logging in to the SafeTravel portal again later today when there are less users on the portal.</p>
