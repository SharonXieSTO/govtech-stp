If you are applying for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (Land) [VTP(Land)], please note the following: 
* <b>Applicants do not need to rush to apply as there is no quota for VTPs, and are advised to secure their bus tickets first.</b> VTPs will be issued immediately if your application and vaccination certificates are complete.
* VTP applications will initially open for travellers entering from <b>29 Nov to 5 Dec, and VTPs are valid for up to 14 calendar days from the travellerâ€™s chosen date of entry</b>. Travellers not travelling during this date range can apply for a VTP later.
* Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents do not need to apply for a VTP.
 
If you intend to proceed with an application, please try logging in to the SafeTravel portal in about an hour's time when the current users are likely to have completed their applications.
