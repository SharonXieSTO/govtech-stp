### 1. Pre-Departure Measures

A) <u>Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</u>

A Pre-Departure COVID-19 test is generally required if you are travelling from a higher risk country/region. <a href="">CLICK HERE</a> to check if a PDT is required. 

If you are required to take a PDT, travellers must take the test <u>within 72 hours before their departure for Singapore</u>. The test must be taken at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing">accredited or authorised testing facility</a> in the country/region of departure, and travellers should ensure that the PDT:

<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.</li>
</ol>

<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Submit an SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/">here within 72 hours before arrival</a></li>

D) <u>TraceTogether Registration</u>

Visitors are required to download and pre-register their profile on the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether app</a> on their mobile devices to aid contact tracing, except for the following groups:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: disc;">

<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Children aged 6 years or younger in the current calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.</li>
</ol>
For the full requirements and conditions governing the use of TraceTogether, please click <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/tt-for-travellers">here</a> .


### 2. Departure for Singapore

During pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked to produce a valid approval letter, or proof of exemption from certain boarding requirements (e.g. pre-departure test exemption). If you were required to take a <a href="#PDT">pre-departure test</a>, please present the valid negative result as well.


### 3. Arrival in Singapore

A) <u>Immigration Clearance</u>

At arrival immigration in Singapore, the visitor must present to the immigration officer:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: disc;"> 
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">a valid entry approval letter (electronic or physical copy)</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders)</li>
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded and with their profile registered on the app (or a TraceTogether token for those eligible to be issued with a token). Visitors must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on their TraceTogether app holding screen immediately after they have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore and follow the instructions to activate the app.</li> 
</ol>

After clearing immigration, depending on the traveller’s 21-day travel history before departing to Singapore, they will receive their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) via the email provided in the <a href="#SGAC">SGAC declaration</a>.

Travellers who are not required to serve a SHN will be required to remain in self-isolation until a negative COVID-19 PCR test result is conveyed, which can take up to 48 hours.

B) <u>On-arrival COVID-19 Tests</u>

Travellers must take their on-arrival <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest">COVID-19 test(s)</a>, and commute directly to their self-isolation accommodation or SDF immediately. Travellers who did not <a href="#paymentlinks">pay for their test(s) before arrival</a>, will pay on the spot.

C) <u>Transport to SHN location</u>

Travellers are prohibited from using public transport (i.e. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) to commute to their SHN/SDF location. See details on transportation arrangements and costs <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/faq#transport">here</a>.


### 4. Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 PCR Tests

Travellers must remain in their SHN/SDF accommodation and will be required to take additional COVID-19 PCR tests during the SHN period to ascertain that they are free of COVID-19.

Travellers who wish to leave their SHN/SDF location for facilitated visits to funerals/wakes or hospitals must have a negative PCR result within the last 72 hours of the visit, or a negative ART result before they can leave their SHN/SDF location. The cost of the ART/PCR tests will be borne by the travellers and paid directly to the test providers. Those who are unable to comply with the pre-visiting testing requirement will not be allowed to leave their SHN/SDF location. 

Travellers who test positive for <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-symptoms">COVID-19</a> will receive the necessary <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covidtreatment">medical treatment</a>, and the prevailing treatment charges would apply.


### 5. Visits to Medical Facility/Funerals

For travellers who received approval to leave their SHN location for short visitations (details of visitation conditions will be conveyed to the travellers separately), the following transport arrangements apply:
<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;"><b>Travellers who are serving SHN at SDFs</b> are to make transport arrangements at their own cost from Strides Transportation Pte Ltd. See details on Strides Transportation Pte Ltd <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/faq#transport3">here</a>.</li> 
<li style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;"><b>Travellers who are serving SHN at other SHN locations</b> (i.e. self-sourced accommodation, place of residence) may self-drive using their own private vehicles or be driven by the <b>same</b> family member who picked them up from the airport. These travellers may also book private hire vehicles. See details on booking private hire vehicles <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/faq#transport2">here</a>.</li>
</ol>


### 6. Completion of Visit or SHN

For travellers serving SHN at an SDF, the checkout timing on completion of the SHN would be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF. Travellers serving SHN at their place of residence are considered to have completed their SHN once a negative test result is conveyed.

If the traveller wishes to leave Singapore before the end of the SHN period <b>due to extenuating circumstances</b>, Please write in via our <a href="">enquiry form</a> under the category “Stay Home Notice Accommodation” and sub-category “<i>Appeal to leave SHN for Exceptional Reasons</i>”. An exit COVID-19 PCR test will be required.
