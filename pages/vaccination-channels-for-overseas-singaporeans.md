### Suspension of Vaccination Channels for Overseas Singaporeans

<p style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.5;">In view of the improved access to COVID-19 vaccines globally and the recent easing of border measures, Singapore will be suspending the vaccination channels for overseas Singaporeans (OS). OS who had earlier registered their interest to use the channels but have not yet returned to Singapore for the vaccination will have to do so <b>by 31 March 2022</b>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.5;">Following the suspension of the vaccination channels, OS who wish to receive vaccine doses in Singapore can do so at the local Vaccination Centres after completing their SHN, if required.</p>
