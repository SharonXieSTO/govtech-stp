## Overview

The following [SHN](/health/shn) end-date calculators are general guides that will help you determine the expected end of your SHN period. Should you have any further SHN-related queries, you may contact the SafeTravel helpline at **6812 5555** for assistance.

For travellers staying at their own accommodation, they may only leave their SHN accommodation after receiving a negative COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test result. 

For travellers serving SHN in an [SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)](/health/shn/sdf), the SDF will inform the traveller of the check-out time once it receives confirmation of the negative COVID-19 test result from the relevant government agencies. The traveller will only be allowed to leave the SDF thereafter.
