### 1) Digitally Verifiable Vaccination Certificate 

<div id="invalidcode"></div>

#### 1. What should I do if my Vaccination Certificates are not accepted in the Vaccination Check Portal or SG Arrival Card?

<b>If verification fails or if travellers do not have a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate, travellers can show their physical vaccination certificate or vaccination app instead</b> with the following details in English, or translated to English with notarisation:
<ol style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Name (per travel document used for entry)</li>
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">At least one other personal identifier, e.g. date of birth or passport number (per travel document used for entry)</li>
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Country of vaccination</li>
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Name of vaccine(s) administered, i.e. different names for different vaccine type</li>
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Vaccination date(s)</li>
	</ol>

You can also attempt to re-upload your digital certificate QR code, and ensure that:
<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">You are using the ‘International’/‘Travel’ version of your vaccination certificate. A common issue is that travellers holding certificates issued by the following countries upload their domestic certificate instead of their travel certificate.
	<ol style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-type: square;">
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">India</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Indonesia</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Thailand</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">The United Arab Emirates</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:20px;">Your QR code was uploaded in a high-resolution, .png <i>(preferred)</i>, .pdf or .jpg format.</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;list-style-type:disc;">Your date of birth was keyed in the correct format (DD/MM/YYYY)</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;list-style-type:disc;">Your digital proof of vaccination is currently a <a href="/files/acceptedvaccinationcertificate.pdf" target="_blank">recognised digital proof of vaccination</a>. More digital certificates will be added to this list in future.</li>
		<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;list-style-type:disc;">If the upload failure involves documents containing more than one QR code, extract/crop the QR code with the latest dose and only upload that QR code.
	</li>
		<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:20px;">You are fully vaccinated, based on <a href="/arriving/overview#vaccination" target="_blank">this criteria</a></li>
		<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">Your passport particulars match with your vaccination certificate. If not, where possible, please contact your healthcare provider or certificate issuer to get your certificate re-issued with your full name as it appears on your travel documentation.</li>
		<li style="line-height:1.35; margin-top:10px;">You replaced any non-latin special characters in your name as per this <a href="#specialchar">FAQ</a>.</li>
	</ol>

For further assistance on certificate uploading issues, you may write to the Safe Travel Office using the enquiry form <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">here</a> and provide supporting details and screenshots of the errors encountered. If the issue is with your vaccination certificate itself (e.g. issued certificate does not have a name matching with your passport), you must approach your certificate issuer instead.


#### 2. Why are only SMART Health Cards by certain issuers accepted?

There is a need for us to verify the identity of the issuer by checking against a list of trusted issuers, such as the CommonTrust Network (issuers listed [here](https://www.commontrustnetwork.org/verifier-list) and [here](https://www.commonhealth.org/smart-health-cards)) and Vaccination Credential Initiative (issuers listed [here](https://vci.org/issuers)).

Please note that individuals with an Excelsior Pass issued by the New York State in United States will need to obtain an Excelsior Pass Plus, which is an SHC accepted for vaccinated travel. More information on the Excelsior Pass and Excelsior Pass Plus can be found <a href="https://forward.ny.gov/excelsior-pass-and-excelsior-pass-plus-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank">here</a>.

We are currently working on accepting digitally verifiable vaccination certificates by other issuers. The list will be expanded as more states and issuers are onboarded.

#### 3. My vaccination certificate was issued in Hong Kong SAR, but I am having issues uploading the QR code. What’s going wrong?

Please attempt re-uploading your QR code and ensure that your electronic vaccination record <b>has the name and ID displayed</b> (unmasked). You may refer to <a href="https://www.evt.gov.hk/portal/en/workflow2" target="_blank">these instructions to download your electronic vaccination records</a>.

### 2) Common Portal Technical Issues

<div id="amendment"></div>

Yes, a fresh application must be submitted. Employers must ensure that the information submitted during application is accurate. There will be no refunds for applications that have been approved.

#### 2. Can I change the traveller’s entry date?

If there are exceptional circumstances for a change in entry date, please write to us using our enquiry form <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">here</a> and provide the traveller’s details including passport number, FIN number (where applicable) and approval reference number.

<div id="receiptandapproval"></div>

### b. Receipts and Approval Letters

#### 1. Can I obtain a copy of the COVID-19 PCR test payment receipt which I paid for during entry application?

The receipt for the COVID-19 PCR test payment would have been generated and displayed at the point of payment via a pop-up window, if the pop-up blocker has been turned off per the instructions during the payment process. We regret to inform that we are unable to generate the same receipt a second time.

#### 2. I have completed payment for my application. However, I did not receive an approval letter. What should I do?

The approval letter will be sent as an email from the SafeTravel Office (SafeTravelOffice@ica.gov.sg) to the email address provided by the applicant shortly after payment. This will be the email address that an email verification OTP is sent from during the application process. Depending on the recipient’s email settings, the approval letter could be found in the recipient’s spam or junk folder.

If the problem persists, please contact us via the enquiry form [here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry) with the following information:
<ul>
<li style="padding-left:15px;">Application Reference Number</li>
<li style="padding-left:15px;">Contact details</li>
<li style="padding-left:15px;">Screenshot of your application status or payment invoice</li>
<li style="padding-left:15px;">(If applicable) FIN and FIN expiry number of your employee(s)</li>
</ul>

Requests to have the approval letter sent to a different email address not stated in the application, will not be entertained.

#### 2. I see an “invalid FIN number” prompt during my application. What does it mean?

This error has likely occurred because the traveller’s Singapore work pass <b>is invalid, has expired or will expire in less than 15 days from the date of entry into Singapore.</b>  

Travellers with the following types of MOM-issued work passes are allowed to travel under the PCA:

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Employment Pass;</li>
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">EntrePass;</li> 
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Personalised Employment Pass;</li> 
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">S Pass;</li> 
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Work Permit;</li> 
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Training Employment Pass;</li> 
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Training Work Permit; and</li> 
  <li style="padding-left:20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">Work Holiday Pass. </li>
</ol>

To apply for or renew a pass, please <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits">visit MOM’s website</a> and click on the relevant pass for more details.

If the error persists even though the traveller’s work pass is valid, please write us using our enquiry form [here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry) and provide the FIN number and FIN expiry date of the employee(s) to be sponsored for entry into Singapore under the PCA scheme.

<div id="shnsdf"></div>


### 3) Stay Home Notice (SHN) 


#### 1. What should I do if I need to attend to an emergency before serving my Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

As a condition for entry into Singapore, all non-fully vaccinated travellers who are required to serve SHN must commute directly to their SHN accommodation or SDF **immediately** after clearing immigration. The failure to do so constitutes a breach of the SHN requirements which is punishable under Singapore’s laws.

In the event of an emergency, travellers may contact the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at **6812 5555** for assistance and advice.


#### 2. I am supposed to serve my SHN at my own place of residence. However, I discovered I am unable to serve my Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at my earlier declared SHN accommodation. What should I do?

Travellers who encounter difficulties serving their SHNs at their declared SHN accommodation may refer to <a href="https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds" target="_blank">this page</a> for more details, or contact the SafeTravel Enquiries helpline at 6812 5555 for assistance and advice. Do not leave your residence until you have received further instructions.

<div id="transport"></div>

### 4) Transport Advisories

#### 1. What are the transport advisories for travellers who have to serve Stay Home Notice?

Travellers can commute using their own private vehicle, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or book a private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL(TADA)) via the provider's respective apps. 

<div id="note1"></div>
	
(i) <u><b>Private Transport Use</b></u>

Travellers can commute using their own private vehicle, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or book a private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL(TADA)) via the provider’s respective apps. This also applies to travellers who have to leave their place of SHN to take their mandatory scheduled PCR test to exit from SHN at the approved testing facility.

If there is more than one traveller, those sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and are heading towards the same declared place of accommodation.

All persons in the vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. In addition, the following precautions are strongly encouraged:-

<ol style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li style="padding-left:15px;">Vehicle windows must be wound down with air conditioning turned off.</li>
		<li style="padding-left:15px;">Where practicable, the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied;</li>
			<li style="padding-left:15px;">The back seat should only be occupied by the traveller(s)</li>			
			<li style="padding-left:15px;">The driver should wipe down the vehicle after dropping the traveller off at his/her declared place of accommodation. Please refer to the National Environmental Agency (NEA) <a href="https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/advisory-on-surface-cleaning-and-disinfection-for-covid-19">guidelines</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>

<div id="note2"></div>

(ii) <u><b>Taxi/private-hire vehicles</b></u>

When securing a transport booking, travellers must inform the transport operator as well as driver that they are served with a <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn">Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</a>. Travellers who opt to arrange for transport using a mobile application may key “<i>SHN</i>” in the chat/note/comment box or by checking the SHN checkbox (if provided within the app). Travellers that board a taxi/private hire car should sit alone in the back seat, with windows down and air-conditioning turned off.

Only travellers with the same travel history and heading to the same declared place of accommodation are allowed to share a taxi/private-hire vehicle, subjected to permitted passenger capacity in the back seat.

All travellers are prohibited from taking public transport, e.g. public buses/trains to their SHN location.

<li style="padding-left:15px;">Non-Malaysian Work Permit Holders (WPHs) holding an In-Principle Approval in the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors, as part of their pre-departure on-boarding process.</li>
</ol>

Recently-recovered travellers who are not fully vaccinated may be exempted from pre-departure test if they produce a valid proof of recovery indicating a positive COVID-19 diagnosis that falls between 14 - 90 days before their date of departure from Singapore.


#### 2. If I am entering a foreign country/region for a very short trip, can I use my negative pre-departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test or Antigen Rapid Test (ART) results, taken in Singapore for departure, to fulfil the pre-departure test requirement for my return leg to Singapore?

You will fulfil the pre-departure test requirement <b>only if the PCR test or professionally administered/supervised ART was taken within 2 days before departure for Singapore.</b>

As an example, a traveller takes a pre-departure ART in Singapore on 1 March 2022 and enters Indonesia on the same day. If he intends to return to Singapore between 1 and 3 March 2022, the ART taken on 1 March 2022 will fulfil the pre-departure test requirement for entry into Singapore.Travellers aged two or below in this calendar year (i.e. born in or after 2020) are, by default, exempted from testing.

### 7) TraceTogether for Travellers


#### 1. Are all travellers required to use TraceTogether?

All travellers must use TraceTogether, <b>except children aged 6 and below</b> in this calendar year.

Travellers to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app prior to their departure for Singapore. Upon arrival, travellers must activate and use the app for the duration of their stay in Singapore. 

Travellers may also obtain a TraceTogether token after arriving in Singapore. As each token is uniquely tagged to each individual, travellers are reminded to carry their own tokens with them wherever they go, and not exchange their tokens with others.

A more comprehensive TraceTogether (TT) FAQ can be found <a href="https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg" target="_blank">here</a>.



#### 2. After downloading the TraceTogether app, how do I activate it?

After downloading the TraceTogether app, you need to follow the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You will need to verify your mobile number with an SMS One-Time Password and register your profile on the app with the <b>same identification number, nationality and date of birth</b> as those shown in the passport that you are using to enter Singapore.
 
Please ensure that your TraceTogether App is updated to the latest version. You will see the Holding Screen after you have registered your profile. <b>You must click on the ‘ACTIVATE APP’ button on the Holding Screen immediately after you have cleared arrival immigration in Singapore</b>. Please follow the instructions until you reach the Home Screen.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Holding Screen</th>
      <th style="text-align:center;">Home Screen</th>

      <td><img src="/images/TraceTogether Home Screen_Vaccinated.png" style="width:179px; height:318px;"></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
 	 
If you require assistance on how to download and activate the TraceTogether app, please refer to the <a href="https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735573-How-do-I-set-up-the-TraceTogether-App-" target="_blank">TraceTogether website</a> or email <a href="mailto:support@tracetogether.gov.sg">support@tracetogether.gov.sg</a>.

#### 3. I have downloaded the TraceTogether app, but I cannot activate the app. What should I do?

Please check that your app has been updated to the latest version.

You can activate your app only <u>after</u> clearing Singapore immigration. There might be a short lag time between after you have cleared immigration and before you can activate the app.
 
If you still are unable to activate your app after immigration clearance, it could be because you did not register your profile with the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport that you have used to enter Singapore. If so, please follow the instructions to be navigated back to the Holding Screen.

You can edit your passport details by clicking the ‘edit’ button on the Holding Screen, as indicated below.

<img src="/images/TraceTogether Holding Screen_VTL.png" style="width:179px; height:318px;">
 
If you still face issues, please email <a href="mailto:support@tracetogether.gov.sg">support@tracetogether.gov.sg</a> with your query and details of the issue you are facing. 

#### 4. If I change my mobile device or SIM card when I arrive in Singapore, do I need to download the TraceTogether app again?

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. 

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

Please ensure that you keep your mobile device’s Bluetooth function turned on so that the TraceTogether app remains activated throughout your stay in Singapore.

#### 5. What happens if travellers do not have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app?

All travellers must have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app. They are responsible for ensuring that their mobile device is compatible with the TraceTogether app. The TraceTogether App can be downloaded from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/tracetogether/id1498276074">iOS App Store</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.gov.tech.bluetrace">Google Play Store</a> and Huawei App Gallery.

Travellers with mobile devices that are unable to download the TraceTogether app, may wish to rent a mobile device that is TraceTogether-compatible. Alternatively, they may obtain a TraceTogether token (S$13/token) from the <a href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/getting-around/tourism-centre/" target="_blank">Singapore Visitor Centre at Orchard Gateway</a> (open from 10am-7pm daily), or any of the TT Token collection booths found at community centres. The community centre booths and their operating hours can be found at <a href="https://token.gowhere.gov.sg" target="_blank">https://token.gowhere.gov.sg</a>. Travellers do not need to return their tokens before departing from Singapore.

Payment can be made via PayNow, EZ-link, Nets Flashpay, Mastercard, VISA, JCB, and Union Pay. Cash payments are not accepted.

<b>Short-Term Visitors may collect or replace Tokens on behalf of family/friends at the Token counters at Community Centres. Visitors will be required to provide the Token owner’s passport and mobile number for verification purposes when collecting and replacing the tokens.</b>

Visitors must carry their rented mobile device or TraceTogether token with them at all times during their stay in Singapore. If you change to another mobile device during your stay in Singapore, you must download and activate the TraceTogether app on that device. You must also retain the app on that device for the rest of your stay.

   
#### 6. What happens if visitors are unable to receive an SMS One-Time Password (OTP) to register their profile on the TraceTogether app?

Travellers who can download the TraceTogether app but are unable to obtain an SMS OTP to register their profile on the app due to network restrictions, can purchase a Singapore SIM card. Upon purchase, travellers are to activate the Singapore SIM card and immediately register their profile on the TraceTogether app with their Singapore mobile number and the same identification number, nationality and date of birth as those shown in the passport used to enter Singapore.


#### 7. Can travellers switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?

No, travellers must keep their mobile devices and the Bluetooth function switched on at all times while in Singapore.

Travellers must upload all data in the TraceTogether app upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health should he/she test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

For TraceTogether token users, authorised personnel may ask to retrieve the token should he/she tests positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

Tokens will be replaced free-of-charge if they stop working due to (1) battery lifespan, (2) manufacturing defect or (3) damage not due to visitor’s negligence. Otherwise, replacements are subject to the same fee.


#### 8. Will my vaccination status show on my TraceTogether app? What should I do if my vaccination status is not updated in TraceTogether or if it expires?

If you were fully vaccinated in <b>Singapore</b>, you should be able to see your vaccination status on your TraceTogether and HealthHub apps.

If you were fully vaccinated <b>overseas</b>, please ensure that you have:

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li><a href="#invalidcode">Uploaded your vaccination certificate on your Vaccination Check Portal/SG Arrival Card submission</a>; or</li>
	<li>Present your overseas vaccination certificate at the immigration counter on-arrival. </li>
	</ol>

Your vaccination status will be updated on your TraceTogether app within 1 day after arrival in Singapore. If your vaccination status has not been updated on your TraceTogether app, kindly submit a query for the relevant team to look into your case: <a href="https://go.gov.sg/vds-query-form" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/vds-query-form</a>.

Travellers vaccinated overseas will be granted a 30-day temporary status by uploading their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate via the Vaccination Check Portal or SG Arrival Card, or by presenting their vaccination certificate to the ICA officer at immigration clearance. Thereafter, the vaccination status will expire. For your vaccination status to continue to be valid, you will need to present your overseas vaccination certificate and undergo a serology test at participating clinics in Singapore. Please call the clinic prior to your visit, to confirm that they provide such services.
