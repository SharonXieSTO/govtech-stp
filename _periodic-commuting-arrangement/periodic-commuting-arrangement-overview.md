The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a Safe Travel Lane agreed between the Governments of Singapore and Malaysia. It supports companies in Singapore and Malaysia by facilitating the movement of workers between both countries. Companies that need to bring their employees into Malaysia or Singapore can sponsor an application.

Under the PCA, approved travellers/employees are required to remain in their country of employment for at least 90 days before returning to their home country for short-term home leave. Cross-border entry under the PCA is only permitted via land at the Causeway and Second link. 

Upon arrival in Singapore, all PCA-approved travellers/employees will be required to take a <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest">COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test</a> ("PCR test") at the checkpoint. Thereafter, they will be served a 14-day <b>(for arrivals before 7 Oct 2021)</b> or 10-day <b>(for arrivals from 7 Oct 2021)</b> <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg/health/shn">Stay-Home Notice</a> (SHN), where they will take three self-administered COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Tests <b>(for arrivals before 7 Oct 2021)</b>, on Day 3, 7 and 11 of their arrival in Singapore and <b>(for arrivals from 7 Oct 2021)</b> they will take two self-administered COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Tests , on Day 3 and 7 of their arrival in Singapore. They will also take a PCR test on Day 14 <b>(for arrivals before 7 Oct 2021)</b> or 10 <b>(for arrivals from 7 Oct 2021)</b>, before they exit their SHN.

Note: From 9 September 2021, 2359 hours, all PCA travellers from Malaysia will need to take a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test within 48 hours before departure to Singapore
