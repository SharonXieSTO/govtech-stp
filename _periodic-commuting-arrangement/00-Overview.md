The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA) is a Safe Travel scheme agreed between the Governments of Singapore and Malaysia. It supports companies in Singapore and Malaysia by facilitating the movement of workers from either country. Companies needing to bring their employees back can sponsor an application.

Under the scheme, PCA-approved travellers/employees are required to remain in their country of employment for at least 90 days before returning to their home country for home leave. Cross-border entry is only permitted at the Causeway and Second link. Upon entry into Singapore, PCA-approved travellers/employees are required to serve a 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) before taking a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.
