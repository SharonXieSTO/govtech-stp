## **Process Overview**

### **Before Entering Singapore**

#### Visa Requirements

After the SafeTravel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be sent via email to the sponsoring company or government agency.

With the SafeTravel Pass approval, an approved traveller who is a visa-required passport holder can proceed to apply for a visa for travel to Singapore through the usual channels. If the approved traveller already has an existing valid visa, the visa suspension will be lifted when the SafeTravel Pass is approved, and he/she need not apply for a new visa. The approved traveller can check his/her visa status [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save).

**Those who do not require a visa prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will not need to apply for a visa for Green/Fast Lane travel.** Please click [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enteranddeparting/before/entryvisa/) for more information on Singapore’s visa requirements.

The approved traveller will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the [SG Arrival Card](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), before departing for Singapore. The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/visit-singapore-travel-guide-app/).

#### Pre-Departure Health Reauirements

Prior to travelling to Singapore, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers are required to:
- Monitor their health status and refrain from travelling to Singapore if feeling unwell;
- Have not travelled out of <country> in the entirety of the 14 days prior to departure;
- Take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours from departure and obtain a certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19. The certificate must be issued by an authorised health centre designated by the Government of <country>. The SafeTravel Pass traveller will bear the cost of the pre-departure PCR test.

Travellers are also strongly encouraged to [register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/) for their post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore. 

If the traveller is unable to make pre-payment before departing for Singapore, please ensure that he/she has a mobile phone with an activated line upon arrival, as on-site payment would typically require an OTP being sent to a registered mobile line. 

Travellers by air and land (in the case of Malaysia) are required to produce the following documents to the airline for pre-boarding checks and at the immigration counter respectively:

  - A valid SafeTravel Pass approval letter (the date of entry into Singapore must fall within the period of entry stated in the letter). Each SafeTravel Pass is valid for a single entry into Singapore;
  - A valid visa to enter Singapore (for visa-required passport holders who are short-term visitors to Singapore);
  - A valid certificate of negative result for a COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours before departure for Singapore (the certificate must be issued by an authorised health centre designated by the Government of the country/region the traveller is departing from); and
  - A return air ticket or proof of other transportation arrangements to depart Singapore.

Travellers by air who do not produce the above documents at pre-boarding checks may be refused boarding.

### **Arrival and Stay in Singapore**

#### Post-Arrival Measures

The SafeTravel Pass traveller will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport/land checkpoint upon arrival in Singapore.  The SafeTravel Pass traveller will bear the costs of the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in Singapore. 

At arrival immigration, approved SafeTravel Pass travellers should declare he/she is a SafeTravel Pass holder, and must produce:
- A valid SafeTravel Pass for the intended week of travel,
- A valid visa (for visa-required passport holders),
- A negative COVID-19 PCR test result,
- A return air ticket.

Approved travellers without these documents will be refused entry into Singapore under the RGL arrangement.

The host<sup>2</sup> company or government agency will transport the traveller directly from the airport/land checkpoint (in the case of Malaysia) to the declared self-sourced accommodation, adhering to prevailing health measures. The applicant must remain in the declared accommodation (non-residential address only) until a negative test result from the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test is released. Thereafter, the traveller can proceed on the pre-declared controlled itinerary. The host company or government agency is responsible for monitoring the traveller’s adherence to the controlled itinerary. 

If tested positive for COVID-19, the traveller will receive medical treatment at his/her own expense. 

#### Measures during stay in Singapore

SafeTravel Pass travellers to Singapore are required to download and use the TraceTogether app for the duration of their stay.  If a traveller does not have a TraceTogether-compatible device, the host company or government agency shall provide one to the traveller.

In addition to abiding by prevailing local public health and safe management measures, the SafeTravel Pass traveller must adhere to a controlled itinerary for the duration of stay. The traveller is prohibited from using public transportation for this purpose, with the exception of private hire cars/taxis or cohorted company transport.
