### **Application**

#### 1. Who is eligible to apply to travel to Brunei under the RGL?

Persons of all nationalities who are legally resident in Singapore (i.e., Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-Term Pass holders) who need to make single-entry, short-term essential travel for business and official purposes, between Singapore and Brunei.

#### 2. How do Singapore residents apply to travel to Brunei under the RGL?

Residents in Singapore seeking to travel to Brunei for short-term essential business or official travel via the RGL must be sponsored by either a registered company or a government agency in Brunei, which will file an application on behalf of the traveller on the Entry Travel Pass website.

The receiving party will be required to upload a signed letter of undertaking and submit the traveller’s controlled itinerary for the first 14 days in Brunei. When the Entry Travel Pass is approved, an approval letter will be issued to both the receiving party in Brunei and the traveller via email.

The registered company intending to host travellers from Singapore will need to get endorsements from the authority relevant to the sector in which the company operates.

#### 3. What is the maximum stay duration in Brunei?

Travellers who are granted entry into Brunei are generally issued with a Visit Pass, of which the duration would be aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### 4. How can I further extend my duration of stay when I am in Brunei, if necessary?

The traveller’s host company or government agency is able to apply for an extension by submitting an application to the Department of Immigration and National Registration of Brunei Darussalam.

#### 5. Is the RGL meant for long-term work and study?

The RGL is only for short-term essential business and official travel, and not for long-term work or study.

For those seeking to enter Brunei for purposes other than essential business and official travel, such as long-term work and study, the host company/agency/institution should apply for the Entry Travel Pass on behalf of the traveller and arrange for the appropriate visas.

#### 6. Who can I contact for more information on the arrangements in Brunei, e.g. accommodation and transport?

The traveller may contact his/her host company or government agency in Brunei to make the necessary arrangements in Brunei.

### **Testing Arrangements**

#### 7. Where do I take a pre-departure PCR test in Singapore? How much does it cost to take the PCR test, and can I pay for it with MediSave or insurance?

The RGL traveller departing for Brunei can make an appointment in advance at designated clinics in Singapore for a pre-departure test at the traveller’s cost. The traveller must take the test within 72 hours before departure, and obtain a health certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19.

The list of clinics that can perform pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests and details on the procedure to book an appointment are at **<a href="#annex">ANNEX</a>**. Testing for fast lane/RGL arrangements should only be carried out at these clinics at the moment. An eligible RGL traveller should contact the clinic directly for testing.

The traveller will need to adhere to the clinic’s cut-off timings for the pre-departure tests to ensure that he/she is able to obtain the test results in time to be allowed to check-in for his/her flight.

The traveller must present at the clinic, a copy of the Entry Travel Pass which confirms that he/she was granted approval by the relevant authorities to travel to Brunei under the Singapore-Brunei RGL, before the swab test can be administered.


#### 8. I had a swab done previously for Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). Can I use the test results for travel under the RGL?

Travellers with Acute Respiratory Infection symptoms should not travel. They should postpone their travel plans.

#### 9. What tests will I be subject to upon arrival in Brunei? Will I be subject to a serology test in Brunei?

The traveller to Brunei will be subject to a COVID-19 PCR test at the designated COVID-19 testing centre on the following day after arrival. The traveller should expect to pay about $350 for the COVID-19 PCR test.

The traveller will not be subject to a serology test.

#### 10. What if I test positive for COVID-19 in Brunei?

If tested positive for COVID-19 in Brunei, the traveller will be accorded the necessary medical treatment by the Bruneian government. The cost of the medical treatment will be borne by the traveller or sponsoring agency.

Minimally, a traveller should have on hand his/her negative COVID-19 PCR test result, a valid visa, proof of installation of the BruHealth application, a valid boarding pass, valid proof of payment for post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, proof of hotel reservation in Brunei, and the approved Entry Travel Pass issued by the Bruneian government specifically for essential business or official travel under the RGL.

As the specific requirements may evolve over time, the traveller should seek an update on the latest requirements with his/her local host company or government agency.

### **Health Measures in Brunei**

#### 12. Do I need to be quarantined upon arrival in Brunei?

The traveller will be isolated at his or her declared hotel of choice and be tested for COVID-19 on the following day after arrival. The hotel will arrange transport for the traveller for testing at a designated testing centre. After undergoing the PCR test, the traveller must remain under isolation until the test results are released, with a usual turnaround time of 24 hours. The traveller or the receiving party in Brunei will bear the costs of the post-arrival test, transport from airport to hotel, and the isolation in the designated accommodation.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested negative for COVID-19, the host company or government agency will ensure that the traveller is transported directly from the declared accommodation to the workplace and back according to the submitted controlled itinerary for up to 14 days of the traveller’s stay in Brunei.

If the result indicates that the traveller has tested positive for COVID-19, he or she will be promptly accorded the necessary medical treatment by the Government of Brunei. The traveller or their receiving party will bear the cost of medical treatment in Brunei.

#### 13. What other health measures will I be subject to in Brunei? What would qualify as a “controlled itinerary” in Brunei?

The traveller must follow local COVID-19 prevention and control measures for the duration of his or her stay in Brunei.

This includes downloading and using the BruHealth application. The traveller is required to self-report their health condition on a daily basis on the BruHealth application for a period of 14 days from arrival or throughout his or her stay in Brunei, if the duration of stay is less than 14 days, even when they have left isolation. The traveller must scan in their locations at all times on the BruHealth application using the QR codes displayed at all premises.

The traveller should verify the latest requirements of the Bruneian authorities with his/her local host company or government agency.

#### 14. What health measures will I be subject to upon returning to Singapore after my RGL travel?

The prevailing health policy is that Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass holders returning from their travel to Brunei Darussalam are not required to serve a Stay-Home Notice, and will instead undergo a COVID-19 test upon arrival and be allowed to continue their activities in Singapore if the test is negative.

Long-Term Pass holders returning on the RGL should present the Entry Travel Pass issued by Brunei upon arrival in Singapore for re-entry into Singapore, and they need not separately seek re-entry approval from other Singapore Government agencies.

Please refer to <https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19> for the latest details and updates on border control measures as well as <https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19/ArrivalSG> for information on the prevailing health measures for returning travellers.

#### 15. Do I have to pay for my COVID-19 medical bills if I am found to have COVID-19 upon return from Brunei?

Travellers will be responsible for charges for COVID-19 treatment if symptoms develop within 14 days of arrival. Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who travelled to Brunei on the Singapore-Brunei RGL may access Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan to help pay for their bills. Long-Term Pass Holders who travelled to Brunei on the Singapore-Brunei RGL may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as foreign worker insurance.
