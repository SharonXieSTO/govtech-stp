The Singapore Citizen (SC) /Permanent Resident (PR) Familial Ties Lane (FTL) is a Safe Travel lane primarily to support the social and community needs of Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, e.g. reuniting families amid the pandemic. This lane caters to both residents and non-residents who need to enter Singapore for one or more of the reasons below:

- Reunite with immediate family members or fiancé/fiancée of an SC/PR;
- Complete formalities for long-term immigration facilities; or
- Handle family emergencies, e.g. death of a family member in Singapore

SC/PRs are not required to seek approval to enter Singapore. However, those who are returning to Singapore should note the entry processes under the [Returning SC/PR lane](/sc-pr/requirements-and-process) instead.

Depending on the travellers’ travel history, they may be required to take [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction tests](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) (“PCR test”) and serve [Stay-Home Notice](/health/shn) (SHN) at either their own accommodation or [SHN-Dedicated Facility](/health/shn/sdf) (SDF) at their own expenses. Travellers can refer to this [table](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) for more details.
