#### 1. I have submitted an entry application to ICA_nCOV_Request@ica.gov.sg. When will I receive the outcome of my application?

For non-residents who have written to <ICA_nCOV_Request@ica.gov.sg> to seek entry into Singapore due to exceptional reasons (e.g. death of a family member in Singapore), ICA will expedite your request.

#### 2. What if I am unable to book a flight within the validity of my approval ?

You are not allowed to amend the date of entry or seek a refund for the payment of the COVID-19 PCR test and SHN dedicated facility (if applicable) once the application has been approved.
 
You would need to resubmit a new application via the new portal at: <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/> or write in to us at <ICA_nCOV_Request@ica.gov.sg> if you had obtained your entry approval due to exceptional reasons.

#### 3. My entry application was unsuccessful. How can I make an appeal?

Each entry application is carefully considered and reviewed before a decision is made. If there are additional or updated information/documents since your last application, you may consider writing to us at <ICA_nCOV_Request@ica.gov.sg>.

Please note that the outcome of a re-appeal will remain the same if there are no changes to your circumstances.

#### 4. I have already submitted an entry application to ICA via https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/, but there are changes to my circumstances, how do I amend the details of my application?

If there are additional or updated information/documents since your last application, you may consider submitting a fresh application online through <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/STO/>.
