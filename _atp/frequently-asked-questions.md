### Overview of the Air Travel Pass (ATP)

#### 1. What is an ATP?

An ATP allows visitors  travelling from one of the following countries/regions to seek entry into Singapore:
- Australia (excluding Victoria State)
- Brunei Darussalam
- Mainland China
- New Zealand

The ATP comes with conditions of travel that the applicant must comply with.

#### 2. How can visitors apply for an ATP?

To apply for an ATP, please go to <https://go.gov.sg/atpsg>. Do note that applications for the ATP must be made between seven and thirty calendar days prior to the intended date of entry into Singapore.

For example, visitors who intend to enter Singapore on 31 January 2021 must apply for an ATP between 1 January 2021 and 24 January 2021.

#### 3. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 4. Is there a fee to apply for an ATP?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of an ATP.

#### 5. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 6. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

If submitting multiple ATP applications, visitors should ensure that the intended date of entry into Singapore for each application is at least 7 calendar days apart. This is because an ATP is valid from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to 7 calendar days after. 

Otherwise, only the application with the latest intended date of entry will be processed and the rest rejected.

#### 7. How long is the validity of an ATP?
An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

For example, visitors who hold a valid ATP to enter Singapore on 1 January 2021, have up to 8 January 2021 to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 8. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. 
This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

#### 9. Do Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders need to apply for an Air Travel Pass?

No, Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an ATP. However, Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

For information on border control measures, please refer to ICA’s website <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg">here</a>.

#### 10. Can travel agents apply for Air Travel Pass on behalf of their clients?

No. Visitors will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the ATP, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

#### 11. Why was my ATP application rejected?

An ATP application may be rejected for reasons such as:
- Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
- Duplicate applications
- Duplicate mobile number submitted <br/> <i>[Note: Each visitor must provide his/her own mobile number and remain contactable at that number throughout his/her stay in Singapore, with the exception of those below 18 years old.]</i>
- Multiple applications with intended dates of entry that are less than 7 days apart<br/>
<i>[Note: If submitting multiple ATP applications, visitors should ensure that the intended date of entry into Singapore for each application is at least 7 calendar days apart. This is because an ATP is valid from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to 7 calendar days after.]</i>
- Invalid or ineligible flight number
- Passport validity is less than 6 months

#### 12. Can visitors use the ATP to transit/transfer through Singapore?

No, the ATP is for visitors who intend to enter Singapore and is not applicable for transfer/transit passengers. At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transfer through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer routes have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Travellers should confirm with their airline on their eligibility to transfer.

### ATP Requirements for Entry into Singapore

#### 1. What are the ATP conditions of travel?

Visitors must comply with the ATP Conditions [here](/atp/conditions).

#### 2. Why must visitors take direct flights without transit to Singapore?

This is to protect public health in Singapore by ensuring that visitors are not travelling to Singapore via a country/region with high virus prevalence rates.

#### 3. What must visitors present to airline staff during check-in at the departure airport for Singapore?

When checking in at the departure airport, visitors must present the following to the airline staff:
- a valid ATP approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the specified period of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required visitors); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app already downloaded and with their profiles registered on the app.

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused boarding by the airline.

Children who are aged 7 to 12 years in that calendar year, and those unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability or special need, are eligible to be issued TraceTogether tokens with payment of a S$50 deposit (in lieu of the requirement to have a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded) at the Changi Recommends booth at Changi Airport upon arrival in Singapore.

Children aged 6 years or younger in that calendar year are exempted from the TraceTogether requirement.

For visitors who do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app or are unable to receive an SMS One-Time Password to register their profile on the TraceTogether app, please refer to Questions 5 and 6 under <a href="#contact">Contact Tracing – TraceTogether</a>.

#### 4. Do visitors need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore?

Visitors travelling on the ATP do not need a return flight ticket to enter Singapore. However, they are advised to check with the relevant authorities on the procedures and approval needed to return to their country/region of departure, or to enter their onward destination.
