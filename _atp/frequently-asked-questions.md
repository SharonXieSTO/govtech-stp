<i>With effect from <b>24 Feb 2022, 2359h (SGT)</b>, short-term visitors with travel history to Hong Kong, within the last 7 days before departure for Singapore, will not be allowed to enter Singapore using the ATP. Travellers holding approved ATPs which are valid for entry before 24 Feb 2022, 2359h (SGT), may continue to travel to Singapore via the ATP. Those who have not applied for an ATP before 17 Feb 2022, 2359h(SGT) but need to travel to Singapore before 25 Feb 2022 urgently may write to the Safe Travel Office at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry</a>.</i>

<i>Travellers who intend to enter Singapore <b>from 24 Feb 2022, 2359h (SGT)</b>, may be eligible for travel under the <a href="/vtl/travel-checklist" target="_blank">Vaccinated Travel Lane (Air)</a>.

#### 3. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 4. Is there a fee payable to travel under the ATP?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of an ATP. 

However, there are <a href="#oat">costs for testing</a> which must be borne by the traveller. 


#### 5. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 6. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

#### 7. How long is the validity of an ATP?

An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

For example, visitors who hold a valid ATP to enter Singapore on 1 October 2021, have up to 8 October 2021 to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 8. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. 
This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

#### 9. Do Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders need to apply for an Air Travel Pass?

No, Singapore Citizens (SC), Permanent Residents (PR), and Long-Term Pass holders must travel via the Returning SC/PRs lane, Work Pass Holder General Lane or Student’s Pass Holder Lane. These travellers should not apply for an ATP to travel to Singapore.

For information on border control measures, please refer to ICA’s website <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg">here</a>.

#### 10. Can travel agents apply for Air Travel Pass on behalf of their clients?

No. Visitors will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the ATP, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

#### 11. Why was I unsuccessful in applying for an ATP?

- Passport validity is less than 6 months
- Failure to complete payment for your on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 

#### 12. Can visitors use the ATP to transit/transfer through Singapore?

No, the ATP is for visitors who intend to enter Singapore and is not applicable for transfer/transit passengers.

Travellers should confirm with their airline on their eligibility to transfer.

### ATP Requirements for Entry into Singapore

#### 1. What are the ATP conditions of travel?

Visitors must comply with the ATP Conditions [here](/atp/conditions).

Visitors may refer to ICA’s website [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa) for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please note that the ATP is <b>not</b> an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.
