### Overview of the Air Travel Pass (ATP)

#### 1. What is an ATP?

An ATP allows visitors  travelling from one of the following countries/regions to seek entry into Singapore:
- Hong Kong
- Macao
- Mainland China
- Taiwan

The ATP comes with [conditions](/atp/conditions) of travel that the applicant must comply with.

#### 2. How can visitors apply for an ATP?

To apply for an ATP, please [click here](/atp/apply-now). Do note that applications for the ATP must be made between seven and 60 calendar days prior to the intended date of entry into Singapore.


#### 3. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 4. Is there a fee to apply for an ATP?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of an ATP. However, with effect from 16 September 2021, applicants will have to make payment for their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test when they receive the payment notification email. Applications will only be approved when payment is received by the deadline indicated in the payment notification email.

For applications made before 16 September 2021, applications will have to make pre-payment for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test separately at [https://safetravel.changiairport.com/](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/)

#### 5. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 6. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

#### 7. How long is the validity of an ATP?
An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

For example, visitors who hold a valid ATP to enter Singapore on 1 October 2021, have up to 8 October 2021 to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 8. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. 
This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

#### 9. Do Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders need to apply for an Air Travel Pass?

No, Singapore Citizens (SC), Permanent Residents (PR), and Long-Term Pass holders must travel via the Returning SC/PRs lane, Work Pass Holder General Lane or Student’s Pass Holder Lane. These travellers should not apply for an ATP to travel to Singapore.

For information on border control measures, please refer to ICA’s website <a href="https://safetravel.ica.gov.sg">here</a>.

#### 10. Can travel agents apply for Air Travel Pass on behalf of their clients?

No. Visitors will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the ATP, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

#### 11. Why was I unsuccessful in applying for an ATP?

An ATP application may be unsuccessful for reasons such as:
- Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
- Passport validity is less than 6 months
- Failure to complete payment for your on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test 

#### 12. Can visitors use the ATP to transit/transfer through Singapore?

No, the ATP is for visitors who intend to enter Singapore and is not applicable for transfer/transit passengers. At this point in time, travellers will only be able to transfer through Singapore Changi Airport if they are travelling with an airline whose transfer routes have been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). Travellers should confirm with their airline on their eligibility to transfer.

<div id="visa"></div>

### Visa Application

#### 1. Do visitors with a valid ATP need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa for travel to Singapore, must separately obtain a visa after receiving their ATP approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.

Visitors may refer to ICA’s website [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa) for information on visa requirements and application.

#### 2. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please note that the ATP is <b>not</b> an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period.

#### 3. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.


<div id="PDT"></div>

### Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test

<div id="PDTnote"></div>

<i style="color:red;">Note: Children aged 2 and below in this calendar year are not required to undergo a pre-departure COVID-19 test.

#### 1. Are visitors required to take any pre-departure COVID-19 tests?

All visitors except those <a href="#PDTnote">listed above</a> must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test or Antigen Rapid Test (ART) within 2 days before departure for Singapore.

The pre-departure COVID-19 test must be taken at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing">internationally accredited or recognised laboratory, clinic, or medical facility</a>. The test result must be in English and state the following:

Travellers who are unable to produce a valid pre-departure COVID-19 test result certificate during check-in at the departure airport will be refused boarding by the airline.

<div id="insurance"></div>

### Mandatory COVID-19 Travel Insurance Coverage

#### 1. Why is there a need for visitors to purchase COVID-19 travel insurance?

This is to ensure that short-term visitors are able to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons, should they be suspected of being infected with COVID-19, or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore. Those who test positive for COVID-19 typically receive care in private hospitals.

#### 2. What is the minimum coverage for COVID-19 travel insurance?

Visitors must purchase travel insurance for the entire duration of their stay in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore. Should their COVID-19 treatment cost go beyond S$30,000, visitors will have to pay for the excess.

#### 3. How can visitors purchase the required insurance coverage?

Visitors must purchase COVID-19 travel insurance prior to their travel to Singapore. The SafeTravel website provides a [list of the Singapore-based insurers’ products](/health/insurance-and-treatment#insurance). Visitors can visit the respective insurers’ websites to purchase the inbound insurance plan. They may reach out to the insurers for more information.

#### 4. Do visitors need to show proof of travel insurance purchase when they apply for the ATP?

Visitors will have to declare, at the point of ATP application, that they will purchase travel insurance, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs, prior to travel to Singapore. They must also carry with them an electronic or physical copy of their insurance policy to facilitate their entry into Singapore.

#### 5. What penalties will be imposed on traveller if he did not buy the insurance prior to entering Singapore?

Purchase of travel insurance is a condition of the Air Travel Pass. Non-compliance with any of the conditions of the Air Travel Pass may result in refusal of entry into Singapore and/or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass. In such an event, the Air Travel Pass holder may be liable for the cost of his/her repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. Future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected.

#### 9. Can my company / family member / friend pick me up from the airport in a private vehicle and transport me to my declared place of accommodation where I will be waiting for my COVID-19 PCR test results?

Visitors entering Singapore on an approved Air Travel Pass may be picked up from the airport by their company / family member / friend in a private vehicle. There should not be more than one person picking the visitor up from the airport. 

Visitors must be transported directly to their declared place of accommodation to await their COVID-19 PCR test results. All persons in the private vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. The following precautionary measures are also strongly encouraged:
- The visitor should sit alone in the back seat and the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied.
- If more than one visitor is picked up, visitors sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and head to the same declared accommodation.
- The vehicle windows should be wound down and the air-conditioning turned off, where practical.

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app.

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

#### 5. What happens if visitors do not have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app?

Alternatively, they may obtain a TraceTogether token (S$13/token) at designated locations in Singapore. Click <a href="/health/tt-for-travellers#token" target="_blank">here</a> for more details.

Visitors must carry their rented mobile device or TraceTogether token with them at all times during their stay in Singapore. If you change to another mobile device during your stay in Singapore, you must download and activate the TraceTogether app on that device. You must also retain the app on that device for the rest of your stay.


#### 6. What happens if visitors are unable to receive an SMS One-Time Password (OTP) to register their profile on the TraceTogether app?

If you were <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated</a> <b>overseas</b>, please upload your vaccination certificate on your SG Arrival Card submission, or present your overseas vaccination certificate at the immigration counter on-arrival. Your vaccination status will be updated on your TraceTogether app around 1 day after arrival in Singapore, and will be valid for 30 days from your date of arrival. Thereafter, your vaccination status will expire. For your vaccination status to be permanently valid, you will need to present your overseas vaccination certificate and undergo a serology test at participating clinics in Singapore. Please call the clinic prior to your visit, to confirm that they provide such services. 

If your vaccination status has not been updated on your TraceTogether app. Kindly submit a query here for the relevant team to look into your case: https://go.gov.sg/vax-status-query.
