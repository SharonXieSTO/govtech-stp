### Travel Checklist – Category (I) Travel History

This checklist is suitable for travellers with travel history to <b>only</b> <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank"><b>Category (I) countries/regions</b></a> in the past 14 days before arrival in Singapore.

Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Periodic Commuting Arrangement, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or Death and Critical Illness Emergency Lane should only refer to the lane specific requirements or their approval letters for instructions.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must apply for entry approval to enter Singapore using a SafeTravel Lane. Details on the appropriate lane to use to enter Singapore can be accessed via the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank" >“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Application for Entry Visa (if applicable)</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit an <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</a> with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration here.

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;"><a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/" target="_blank">Register and pre-pay</a> for their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (S$160)</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">	Install <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> mobile applications on their mobile phones which will facilitate SHN compliance checks and contact tracing</li>
</ol>

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident may be asked to produce their valid Entry Approval Letter. This is to ensure that the traveller has been approved for entry into Singapore.

### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

During immigration clearance, provide all relevant documents and information required by the immigration officer, including proof of tests taken if necessary. 

<b>Eligible travellers vaccinated overseas should also inform the immigration officer to temporarily register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether app</b>, in order to be eligible for vaccination-differentiated measures within Singapore (e.g. visiting malls, dining out). Travellers staying longer than 30 days will need to take a serology test to extend their vaccination status. <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">Click here for more details on the eligibility criteria and procedure for registering vaccination status</a>. 

For visitors granted entry, please note that <b>all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore via air will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) and period of stay granted through email</b>. There will not be any physical endorsement on the visitor's passport unless arriving by land or sea. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">Click here for more information about the e-Pass</a> .

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test. If you did not <a href="#payment" target="_blank">pay for the test before arrival</a>, you will pay on the spot but can expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Transport to Declared Self-Isolation Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers are required to commute directly to the declared SHN accommodation using their own private transport, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL Tada). 

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses) is strictly prohibited. 

### Stage 4: Self-isolation

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve self-isolation period</b></i>

Travellers may self-isolate in the following accommodations:
- Place of residence; or 
- Hotel of choice.

Travellers without a suitable place of residence may self-isolate at a hotel found in this <a href="https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation" target="_blank">non-exhaustive list</a>. Before a booking is made, travellers should check and ensure that the hotel can accommodate guests who are self-isolating for their COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”) result. During this period of self-isolation, the traveller is prohibited from leaving the SHN accommodation.

### Stage 5: End of Self-isolation period

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from self-isolation</b></i>

Travellers may only leave their accommodation only **after** a negative result of the COVID-19 test taken on arrival in Singapore is conveyed. The result could be released to the traveller via a call, email, or SMS. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>. 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/covidtreatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> 

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, <a href="/health/vtsg#VDSMM" target="_blank">click here to check how to get your vaccinated status recognised in Singapore.</a> 

Travellers should also use the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
