### Travel Checklist – Category (III) Travel History

This checklist is **only** suitable for travellers with travel history to any Category (III) country/region in the past 14 days before arrival in Singapore. Return to <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">this list of countries/regions</a> if you are unsure if you come under this travel history category. Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Periodic Commuting Arrangement, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or Death and Critical Illness Emergency Lane should refer to the lane-specific requirements or their approval letters for instructions. 

Travellers may print out this page and indicate with a **"&#9745;"** in the box **(&#9744;)** for completed activities.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

<div id="stage1a"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must apply for entry approval to enter Singapore using a SafeTravel Lane. Details on the appropriate lane to use to enter Singapore can be accessed via the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Application for Entry Visa (if applicable)</b></i>

Travellers who are not Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long Term Pass holders holding passports issued by visa-required countries/regions should apply for an entry visa. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa or wish to apply for a visa may <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements" target="_blank">check the main ICA site</a> for more information.

<div id="stage1c"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Pre-Departure COVID-19 Test (PDT)</b></i>

Travellers must take a PDT **within 2 days before departure** for Singapore, unless they:
- Are below the age of three in this calendar year; or
- Have remained in any <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category (I) country/region</a> in the past 14 consecutive days before departure; or
- Are Singapore Citizens entering Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link.

Travellers can take either a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing" target="_blank">internationally accredited or recognised lab/clinic/medical facility</a> <b>OR</b> an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) administered by a trained professional, including a medical professional or government-recognised trained professional in the country/region of departure. <b>Self-swabs are not allowed</b>. They should also obtain a copy of the negative test result that meets the following conditions, as it will be used as proof that the traveller had been tested for COVID-19:
- Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
- Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore);
- Reflects the date and result of the test; and
- Is not handwritten.

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 test before their departure can <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">contact the Safe Travel Office for assistance</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit an <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</a> with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration here. Travellers should **defer their travels** if they experience any of the following conditions: 

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Showing COVID-19 symptoms</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Are diagnosed or suspected to have contracted COVID-19 in the last 14 days before departing for Singapore; or</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Had been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient in the last 10 days before departing for Singapore. This includes the provision of care for a COVID-19 patient in a healthcare or family/social setting, staying in the same location as a COVID-19 positive patient, or had been in close (i.e. less than two meters) contact with a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Installation of Contact Tracing apps</b></i>

Install and activate the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/download" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> mobile applications, which will facilitate SHN compliance checks and contact tracing.

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and
- Valid Pre-Departure test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result (see [Stage 1C](#stage1c))

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

During immigration clearance, provide all relevant documents and information required by the immigration officer, including proof of tests taken if necessary. 

<b>Eligible travellers vaccinated overseas should also inform the immigration officer to temporarily register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether app</b>, in order to be eligible for vaccination-differentiated measures within Singapore (e.g. visiting malls, dining out). Travellers staying longer than 30 days will need to take a serology test to extend their vaccination status. <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">Click here for more details on the eligibility criteria and procedure for registering vaccination status</a>. 

For visitors granted entry, please note that <b>all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore via air will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) and period of stay granted through email</b>. There will not be any physical endorsement on the visitor's passport unless arriving by land or sea. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">Click here for more information about the e-Pass</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 10-day <a href="/health/shn" target="_blank">Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</a> will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card" target="_blank">
SGAC declaration</a>. The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

<div id="stage3D"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Transport to SHN Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers with 14-day travel history to Category (III) countries/regions will be able to commute using their own private transport, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL Tada). 

Travellers must rely on the same transport options when commuting from their SHN accommodation to the testing facility for the exit-SHN COVID-19 PCR test on the last day of SHN. 

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses) is strictly prohibited in all cases.

### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click here for an <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">SHN calculator</a>.

Travellers may complete their SHN at their own residence, self-sourced hotel, or serviced apartment. Travellers planning to serve their SHN at a self-sourced hotel should only secure their bookings after checking and ensuring that the hotel of choice can accommodate guests on SHN. Travellers may refer to <a href="https://sha.org.sg/stay-home-notice" target="_blank">this page</a> for the non-exhaustive list of hotels offering SHN-accommodation.


During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. <a href="/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks" target="_blank">Click here for more information on SHN-related compliance matters</a>.

<div style="padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 20px; font-size:16px; line-height:1.0; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom:20px;">
<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:16px; line-height:1.5;"><b>[Advisory for travellers serving SHN at home]</b> Travellers may serve SHN at their residence, with other household members, regardless of vaccination status or travel history. However, travellers residing with unvaccinated vulnerable household members, are strongly encouraged to serve their SHN in isolation in a room and minimise contact with their vulnerable household members. If this is not feasible, travellers are advised to consider alternative accommodation.</p>
	<p style="margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; font-size:16px; line-height:1.5;">Travellers should designate a specific bathroom to be used by themselves. If a bathroom has to be shared, the following actions are suggested:</p>
	<ol style="margin-top:0px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="font-size:16px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Lower the lid before flushing the toilet;</li>
		<li style="font-size:16px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Clean and disinfect contact surfaces after each use; and</li>
		<li style="font-size:16px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.5;">Avoid using the toilet for at least 20 minutes after it is used by the person who is serving SHN.</li>
	</ol>
</div>


&#9744;  <i><b>B) End-of-SHN COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) before the end of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. Travellers may end their SHN arrangements upon receipt of a negative test result or when they complete the 10-day SHN period, whichever is later. 

The test costs SGD$125 (including GST). Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will be advised on payment details after arrival. All other travellers would have paid for the test at the point of entry application.


### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation once they are informed that their end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered.. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>. 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/covidtreatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> 

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, <a href="/health/vtsg#VDSMM" target="_blank">click here to check how to get your vaccinated status recognised in Singapore.</a> 

Travellers should also use the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
