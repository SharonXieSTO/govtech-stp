<i>Readers who have arrived on this page directly from a search engine or are new to the entry-requirements imposed by Singapore during the pandemic, should start from the <a href="/arriving/overview">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page. Travellers who do not meet the entry-requirements will be turned away from Singapore. </i>

### Travel Checklist – Category (III) Travel History

This checklist is suitable **only** for travellers with travel and transit history to any Category (III) country/region in the past 21 days before arrival in Singapore. Return to this menu if you are unsure if you come under this travel history category. Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or Death and Critical Illness Emergency Lane should not refer to this document but refer to the lane specific requirements or refer to their approval letters for instructions. 

Travellers may print out this page and indicate with a **"&#9745;"** in the box **(&#9744;)** for completed activities.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must apply for entry approval to enter Singapore using a SafeTravel Lane. Details on the appropriate lane to use to enter Singapore can be accessed via the “Travelling to Singapore” page.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</b></i>

Travellers must take a PDT **within 48 hours before departure** for Singapore, unless they:
- Below the age of three in this calendar year; or
- Have remained in any [Category (I) country/region]() in the past 21 consecutive days before departure; or
- Are Singapore Citizen entering Singapore via the Causeway or Second Link.

Travellers are required to take their PDT at an [accredited or authorised testing facility](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing) in the country/region of departure and ensure that the PDT:
- Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
- Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and
- Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 PCR test before their departure can contact the Safe Travel Office [here](/contact-us).

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Submission of Declarations & Registration/Payment for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Travellers who are fit for travel, i.e. not showing any COVID-19 symptoms, must:

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Submit an SG Arrival Card (SGAC) with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/">here</a></li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test, if they are arriving via air (<a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/">register here</a>), sea or land (<a href="https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton">register here</a>)</li>
		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/">TraceTogether</a> mobile application for use in Singapore</li>
</ol>

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Application for Entry Visas</b></i>

Valid entry-visa holders and visa-exempted travellers are not required to apply for an entry visa to enter Singapore. Travellers who are unsure if they require an entry-visa or wish to apply for a visa may click [here](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/visa_requirements) for more information.

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Request for alternative Stay-Home Notice (SHN) arrangements</b></i>

Travellers will, **by default**, serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an assigned hotel. Such hotels are also known as SHN-Designated Facility (SDF). Due to fast-changing SDF demands, travellers would not be informed of their assigned hotel before arrival in Singapore.

Exceptions to the norm, however, will be considered for specified groups of travellers. Exceptions to the norm, i.e. completing SHN at the traveller’s own residence, will be considered for special cases below. Unless otherwise indicated, all applications must be submitted **at least three working days before arrival** in Singapore.

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and
- Valid Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

Follow the instructions provided by the relevant ground officers and signages on arrival. 

As part of immigration clearance, travellers will be asked for their PDT report showing a negative COVID-19 result. Failing which, they may be turned away, and/or have their entry/re-entry or work-related permits and passes cancelled. 

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price) test. If you did not [pay for the test before arrival](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price), you will pay on the spot but can expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their [SGAC declaration](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card). The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Transport to Declared Self-Isolation Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers will commute directly to their declared SHN accommodation using their own private vehicle, or pre-booked taxi/private hire car with any of the following transport operators:

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is prohibited. Travellers must rely on the same transport options when commuting from their SHN accommodation for the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN. To guarantee a smooth journey, click [here](/health/faq#transport) for the relevant transport advisories.

### Stage 4: Self-isolation

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click here for an SHN calculator. Travellers may complete their SHN at their own residence, self-sourced hotel, or serviced apartment. Travellers planning to serve their SHN at a self-sourced hotel should only secure their bookings after checking and ensuring that the hotel of choice can accommodate guests on SHN. Travellers may refer to [this page](https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation) for the non-exhaustive list of hotels offering SHN-accommodation.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. For more information on SHN-related compliance matters, click [here](/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks).

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests during SHN</b></i>

Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) on the last day of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via [this form](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry).


### Stage 5: End of Self-isolation period

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation only after the end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated to you via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the  [HealthHub App](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices). 

Travellers who test positive for [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) will and must receive [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Advisory on prevailing COVID-19 management in Singapore</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but must comply with the latest public health measures.This includes the use of the [TraceTogether app](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/), which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case. For the latest measures visit the Ministry of Health [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory) for more details.

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, click [here](/health/vtsg) for details on whether you qualify, and how to receive local recognition as a “fully vaccinated traveller”.
