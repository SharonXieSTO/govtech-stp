### Travel Checklist – Death & Critical Illness Emergency Visit Lane	

This checklist is suitable only for travellers who have been approved for entry on an urgent basis via the Death and Critical Illness Emergency Visit Lane (DCEV).

Return to “Travelling to Singapore” for more details. 

Given the nature of the visit, arrangements will be made to allow travellers to make short and safe visits to the medical facility and/or funeral. Otherwise, scroll-down or click on the links for health-related protocols applicable based on the relevant stage of your journey.

### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
-Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click [here](/shn-calculator) for an SHN calculator.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. For more information on SHN-related compliance matters, click [here](/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks).

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests during SHN</b></i>

**All** Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) on the last day of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via [this form](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry).

Travellers must also administer an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on their own on Days 3, 7 and 11 of their arrival in Singapore. [Click here](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/selftestart) for more information on ARTs. Travellers are exempted from ART, if they have been approved to complete their SHN in their residence or accommodation of choice.

### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation only **after** the end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated to you via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered.. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the  [HealthHub App](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices). 

For travellers serving SHN at an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), the checkout timing will be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF and they can only leave after the SDF staff have informed them to do so. 

Travellers who test positive for [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) will and must receive [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Advisory on prevailing COVID-19 management in Singapore</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but **must** comply with the latest public health measures.This includes the use of the [TraceTogether app](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/), which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case. For the latest measures visit the Ministry of Health [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory) for more details.

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, click [here](/health/vtsg) for details on whether you qualify, and how to receive local recognition as a “fully vaccinated traveller”.
