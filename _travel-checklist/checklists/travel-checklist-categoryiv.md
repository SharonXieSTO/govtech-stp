All handwritten copies of the report will be rejected. Travellers with difficulties getting their PDT can <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">contact the Safe Travel Office for assistance</a>.


<div id="stage1d"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit their pre-trip health and travel history declaration via <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</a>. Travellers managing a medical condition using a nebuliser should also declare their condition the link provided in their entry approval letter.

All SCAG submissions are free-of-charge, and <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated travellers</a> should also upload their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate, i.e. certificate with a QR code. Upon verification, the travellers’ vaccination status will be reflected in HealthHub or the TraceTogether application for 30 days, which can be used in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moh-smm" target="_blank">vaccinated-differentiated settings</a>.

Travellers should **defer their travels** if they:

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Are showing COVID-19 symptoms;</li>

Travellers will, by default, serve their 10-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an assigned hotel, i.e. an SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). Payment for a 10-day SHN stay at an SDF, inclusive of food-related costs, is collected during entry approval (see Stage 1A; indicative costs below). Due to fast-changing SDF demands, travellers will not be informed of their assigned hotel before arrival. Travellers may request for inter-connecting rooms or suites. All additional lodging cost will be communicated and collected from the traveller directly by the SDF operator.

	</table>

Travellers suffering from a critical illness or have a mobility issue or special medical, making the completion of SHN at an SDF difficult, may seek approval to complete their SHN at a place of residence. <a href="https://go.gov.sg/shnhotelneeds" target="_blank">Approvals must be sought</a> at least three working days before arrival in Singapore. If the domestic public health risk assessment changes, all prior approvals can be rescinded, and the traveller will complete their SHN at an SDF.

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

To ensure that the traveller is approved for entry into Singapore, travellers may be asked by the airline or transport operator to produce the following during pre-boarding checks:

<p style="font-size:14px;margin-bottom:15px;">(Tick if completed)</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:0px; line-height:1.5;">☐ i. Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:0px; line-height:1.5;">☐ ii. Valid Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result (per <a href="#stage1c">Stage 1C</a>)</p>

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

<div id="stage3a"></div>
	
&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

During immigration clearance, provide all documents, including proof of tests, and information required by the immigration officer. Upon clearance, air travellers will receive an email, as provided in the SG Arrival Card (see Stage 1D), of their <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">e-Pass (i.e. Visit Pass)</a> <b>which will reflect the period of stay granted</b>. Travellers who are cleared for entry via Land or Sea, will continue to receive to have their passport physically endorsed. 
	
During immigration clearance, <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated travellers</a> who meet the following conditions may seek the assistance of the immigration officer to register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether App (see <a href="#stage1e">Stage 1E</a>):

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Aged 12 and above;</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Do not possess a digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate, i.e. certificate with a QR code for verification; and</li>
	<li style="line-height:1.5;">Possess the original vaccination document, stating the type and date(s) for which the vaccine was administered. All vaccination documents must be in English, or translated to English by a translation service provider, notary public or embassy of the country of document issuance.</li>
</ol>

Once registered, the traveller will be able to show proof of their vaccination status using the TraceTogether Application in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moh-smm" target="_blank">vaccination-differentiated settings (e.g. malls, dining out)</a>. All registrations performed during immigration clearance are valid only for 30 days. Travellers staying in Singapore beyond 30 days, or those who had not registered their vaccination status during immigration clearance, should visit <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---post-vaccination-matters" target="_blank">MOH’s website</a> (under “Recognising Overseas Vaccination”) for more details.

<div id="stage3b"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>B) On-arrival COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Follow the instructions of officers on the ground and take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test. 

Travellers who did not pay for the test before arrival (see <a href="#stage1e">Stage 1E</a>), will do so on the spot and expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 10-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) which takes effect immediately on the day of issuance, will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their SGAC declaration (see <a href="#stage1d">Stage 1D</a>). 

<div id="stage3d"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Transport to SHN Accommodation</b></i>

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is strictly prohibited. Travellers serving their SHN at an **SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)** will commute using the government-provided transport. 

Those approved to complete their SHN at their own accommodation (see <a href="#stage1f">Stage 1F</a>), will commute Strides Transportation. All <a href="/health/faq#transport" target="_blank">transport booking</a> must be made directly with Strides Transportation (Tel: 6477 5977), and the following costs will apply:

### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance, and travellers must remain in their declared SHN accommodation per the period specified in the SHN. To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click here for an <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">SHN calculator</a>.

The failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers will first be issued an Electronic Monitoring Device (EMD) from ICA to ensure compliance. For subsequent breaches, the errant traveller can be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. During the SHN period, <a href="/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks" target="_blank">randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted</a> (see advisory below), and travellers may only leave their SHN accommodation when the following scenarios occur:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken before the end of the SHN.

The commuting arrangement stated at <a href="#stage3d">Stage 3D</a> will apply for scenarios (a) and (b), above. Travellers requiring essentials during the SHN period may opt for home delivery service or enlist the help of others. When collecting these items, avoid collecting them personally. For other SHN-related need, you may reach the SafeTravel Helpline at 6812 5555 (call charges apply) for assistance

	<p style="font-size:16px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.5; color:red;"><b><u>Anti-Scam Advisory:</u></b></p>
		<p style="font-size:16px; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.5;color:black;">All in-person or phone/video compliance checks are conducted by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) or the Ministry of Education (MOE). Authorised officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identify. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked for the last four digits of their Identity Card or Travel Document for identity verification. Any request for payment or credit card details made over phone may be a scam.
			</p>
			<p style="font-size:16px; margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:0px;line-height:1.5;color:black;">If you suspect you have received a scam call, please contact the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000.
			</p>
	</div>
	
&#9744;  <i><b>B) Tele-consultation for Nebuliser-using Travellers</b></i>

Travellers using a nebuliser to manage a medical condition must arrange for a tele-consultation upon arrival at the SHN, where they will be assessed for their suitability to use an inhaler/spacer.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) End-of-SHN COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Travellers are scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) before the end of their SHN. Payment for the test (S$125/test, including GST) for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) is already collected during entry approval (see <a href="#stage1a">Stage 1A</a>). For SC/PRs, the test payment details will be communicated separately after arrival in Singapore.

The test is compulsory, and travellers who fail to receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance using <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. Travellers who are unwell on the day of the test should remain in their accommodation and <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tc" target="_blank">alert the relevant agencies</a>.

### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers serving SHN at an SDF will be informed of the checkout timing by the SDF operator.

For travellers serving SHN at a place of residence, the SHN will end after the traveller receives a negative test result (see Stage 4B) or upon completion of the 10-day SHN, whichever is later. The result of the test will be communicated via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>. 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/insurance-and-treatment#treatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

Travellers may go about their activities while complying with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> This includes the use of TraceTogether, to facilitate the identification of close contacts of a COVID-positive case.

For vaccination-differentiated settings, e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions, travellers will be required to produce proof of vaccination. Travellers who have registered their vaccination status on their TraceTogether application may do so using the app (see <a href="#stage3a">Stage 3A</a>).
