An acceptable PDT includes only a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test that must take a PDT at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing" target="_blank">accredited or authorised testing facility</a> in the country/region of departure. As proof of compliance, i.e. traveller had taken a PDT, travellers must obtain a copy of the negative PCR test result that meets the following conditions:

<p style="font-size:14px;margin-bottom:15px;">(Tick if completed)</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:0px; line-height:1.5;">☐ i.	Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);</p>

<p style="margin-left:20px; margin-top:0px;line-height:1.5;">☐ iii.	Reflects the date and result of the test.</p>

All handwritten copies of the report will be rejected. Travellers with difficulties getting their PDT can <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">contact the Safe Travel Office for assistance</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit their pre-trip health and travel history declaration via <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</a>. Travellers managing a medical condition using a nebuliser should also declare their condition the link provided in their entry approval letter.

All SCAG submissions are free-of-charge, and <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">fully vaccinated travellers</a> should also upload their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate, i.e. certificate with a QR code. Upon verification, the travellers’ vaccination status will be reflected in HealthHub or the TraceTogether application for 30 days, which can be used in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moh-smm" target="_blank">vaccinated-differentiated settings</a>.

Travellers should **defer their travels** if they:

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Are showing COVID-19 symptoms;</li>

Being in close contact includes, caring for a patient in a healthcare or family/social setting, staying in the same location as the patient, or had been in close (i.e. less than two meters) contact with a patient for more than 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<div id="stage1e"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Registration and Pre-payment for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test and Installation of TraceTogether app</b></i>

Travellers who are fit for travel and have completed Stages 1A to D, should:

<div id="1F"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>F) Request for alternative Stay-Home Notice (SHN) arrangements</b></i>

Travellers will, by default, serve their 10-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an assigned hotel, i.e. an SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). Payment for a 10-day SHN stay at an SDF, inclusive of food-related costs, is collected during entry approval (see Stage 1A; indicative costs below). Due to fast-changing SDF demands, travellers will not be informed of their assigned hotel before arrival. Travellers may request for inter-connecting rooms or suites. All additional lodging cost will be communicated and collected from the traveller directly by the SDF operator.

  </table>

Travellers should note that any prior approvals given to complete the SHN at a place of residence may be rescinded should the public health risk assessment change. In such an event, the prevailing travel health control measures would apply, i.e. serving SHN at an SDF.

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and
- Valid Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result (per [Stage 1C](#stage1c))

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

During immigration clearance, provide all relevant documents and information required by the immigration officer, including proof of tests taken if necessary. 

<b>Eligible travellers vaccinated overseas should also inform the immigration officer to temporarily register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether app</b>, in order to be eligible for vaccination-differentiated measures within Singapore (e.g. visiting malls, dining out). Travellers staying longer than 30 days will need to take a serology test to extend their vaccination status. <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">Click here for more details on the eligibility criteria and procedure for registering vaccination status</a>. 

For visitors granted entry, please note that <b>all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore via air will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) and period of stay granted through email</b>. There will not be any physical endorsement on the visitor's passport unless arriving by land or sea. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">Click here for more information about the e-Pass</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) On-arrival COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test at Changi Airport. Travellers are required to <a href="#stage1e">book and pre-pay</a> for the test before arrival. Without advance booking, travellers can expect delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 10-day <a href="/health/shn" target="_blank">Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</a> will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card" target="_blank">SGAC declaration</a>. The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Transport to SHN Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers who are serving their SHN at an **SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)** will take the government-provided transport. 

Travellers who have obtained approval to serve SHN at their own accommodation must make a <a href="/health/faq#transport" target="_blank">transport booking</a> with the transport provider, Strides Transportation (Tel: 6477 5977). The following costs will apply, which will be borne by the traveller.

Travellers must rely on the same transport options they used for commuting from their SHN accommodation, when commuting to the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN.

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is strictly prohibited.


### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken before the end of the SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click here for an <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">SHN calculator</a>.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. <a href="/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks" target="_blank">Click here for more information on SHN-related compliance matters</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) End-of-SHN COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) before the end of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. 

The test costs SGD$125 (including GST). Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will be advised on payment details after arrival. All other travellers would have paid for the test at the point of entry application.

### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

For travellers serving SHN at an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), the checkout timing will be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF and they can only leave after the SDF staff have informed them to do so. 

Travellers serving SHN at a place of residence may end their SHN arrangements upon receipt of a negative test result or when they complete the 10-day SHN period, whichever is later. The result of the test will be communicated via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>. 

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/insurance-and-treatment#treatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> 

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, <a href="/health/vtsg#VDSMM" target="_blank">click here to check how to get your vaccinated status recognised in Singapore.</a> 

Travellers should also use the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
