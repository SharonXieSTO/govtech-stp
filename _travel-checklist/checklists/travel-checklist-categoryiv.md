<i>Readers who have arrived on this page directly from a search engine or are new to the entry-requirements imposed by Singapore during the pandemic, should start from the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page. Travellers who do not meet the entry requirements may be turned away from Singapore. </i>

### Travel Checklist – Category (IV) Travel History

This checklist is **only** suitable for travellers with travel history (excluding transit) to any Category (IV) country/region in the past 14 days before arrival in Singapore. Return to <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">this menu</a> if you are unsure if you come under this travel history category. Travellers arriving in Singapore via the Work Pass Holder General Lane, Air Travel Pass, Periodic Commuting Arrangement, Reciprocal Green Lane, Vaccinated Travel Lane or Death and Critical Illness Emergency Lane should refer to the lane-specific requirements or their approval letters for instructions. 

Travellers may print out this page and indicate with a **"&#9745;"** in the box **(&#9744;)** for completed activities.

### Stage 1: Pre-Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Application for Entry Approval</b></i>

All travellers, except Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents, must apply for entry approval to enter Singapore using a SafeTravel Lane. Details on the appropriate lane to use to enter Singapore can be accessed via the <a href="/arriving/overview" target="_blank">“Travelling to Singapore”</a> page.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (PDT)</b></i>

Travellers must take a PDT **within 48 hours before departure** for Singapore, unless they:
- Below the age of three in this calendar year; or
- Have remained in only <a href="/shn-and-swab-summary" target="_blank">Category (I) country/region</a> in the past 14 consecutive days before departure.


Travellers are required to take their PDT at an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/accreditation-bodies-for-covid-19-testing" target="_blank">accredited or authorised testing facility</a> in the country/region of departure and ensure that the PDT:
- Is in English (or accompanied with an English translation);
- Contains the traveller's name, and Date of Birth or Passport number (per the passport used to travel to Singapore); and
- Reflects the date and result of the PCR test.

Travellers with difficulties getting a COVID-19 PCR test before their departure can contact the <a href="/contact-us" target="_blank">Safe Travel Office</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Submission of Health Declaration</b></i>

Up to 72 hours before arrival in Singapore, travellers should submit an <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC)</a> with their pre-trip health and travel history declaration here. Travellers should **defer their travels** if they experience any of the following conditions: 

<ol style="font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">
	<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Showing COVID-19 symptoms</li>

		<li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.5;">Had been in close contact with a COVID-19 positive patient in the last 10 days before departing for Singapore. This includes the provision of care for a COVID-19 patient in a healthcare or family/social setting, staying in the same location as a COVID-19 positive patient, or had been in close (i.e. less than two meters) contact with a COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes.</li>

<div id="1F"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Request for alternative Stay-Home Notice (SHN) arrangements</b></i>

Travellers will, **by default**, serve their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at an assigned hotel. Such hotels are also known as SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF). Due to fast-changing SDF demands, travellers would not be informed of their assigned hotel before arrival in Singapore.

Exceptions to the norm, however, will be considered for specified groups of travellers. Exceptions to the norm, i.e. completing SHN at the traveller’s own residence, will be considered for special cases below. Unless otherwise indicated, all applications must be submitted **at least three working days before arrival** in Singapore.

  </table>

Travellers should note that any prior approvals given to complete the SHN at a place of residence may be rescinded should the public health risk assessment change. In such an event, the prevailing travel health control measures would apply, i.e. serving SHN at an SDF.

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and
- Valid Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PDT) showing a negative COVID-19 result

Travellers without the above may be denied boarding.


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance</b></i>

During immigration clearance, provide all relevant documents and information required by the immigration officer, including proof of tests taken if necessary. 

<b>Eligible travellers vaccinated overseas should also inform the immigration officer to temporarily register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether app</b>, in order to be eligible for vaccination-differentiated measures within Singapore (e.g. visiting malls, dining out). Travellers staying longer than 30 days will need to take a serology test to extend their vaccination status. <a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">Click here for more details on the eligibility criteria and procedure for registering vaccination status</a>. 

For visitors granted entry, please note that <b>all foreign visitors arriving in Singapore via air will be notified digitally of their Visit Pass (e-Pass) and period of stay granted through email</b>. There will not be any physical endorsement on the visitor's passport unless arriving by land or sea. The e-Pass notification will indicate the period of stay granted and last day of stay allowed. Please ensure that you provide a valid email address when submitting the SG Arrival Card to ensure that you receive the e-Pass. <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information about the e-Pass.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Take an on-arrival <a href="/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price" target="_blank">COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test</a>. If you did not <a href="/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price" target="_blank">pay for the test before arrival</a>, you will pay on the spot but can expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

Category(IV) travellers arriving in Singapore from **26 Oct 2021, 2359 hours** will not be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test on arrival in Singapore. 

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 10-day <a href="/health/shn" target="_blank">Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</a> will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card" target="_blank">SGAC declaration</a>. The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Transport to SHN Accommodation</b></i>

Travellers who are serving their SHN at an **SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)** will take the government-provided transport. 

Travellers who have obtained approval to serve SHN at their own accommodation must make a <a href="/health/faq#transport" target="_blank">transport booking</a> with the transport provider, Strides Transportation (Tel: 6477 5977). The following costs will apply, which will be borne by the traveller.

Travellers must rely on the same transport options they used for commuting from their SHN accommodation, when commuting to the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN.

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is strictly prohibited.


### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
-Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click here for an <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">SHN calculator</a>.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. For more information on <a href="/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks" target="_blank">SHN-related compliance matters</a>.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests during SHN</b></i>

**ALL** travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) on Day 10 of their arrival. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. 

Travellers arriving **before 26 Oct 2021, 2359 hours** must also self-administer an ART on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival in Singapore <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19/selftestart" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more information on ARTs. Travellers are exempted from ART, if they have been approved to complete their SHN in their residence or accommodation of choice.


### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation only **after** the end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated to you via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>. 

For travellers serving SHN at an SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF), the checkout timing will be conveyed to the traveller by the SDF and they can only leave after the SDF staff have informed them to do so. 

Travellers who test positive for <a href="/health/covid19-symptoms" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> will and must receive <a href="/health/covidtreatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>. The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but <b>must</b> comply with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures.</a> 

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, <a href="/health/vtsg#VDSMM" target="_blank">click here to check how to get your vaccinated status recognised in Singapore.</a> 

Travellers should also use the <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether app</a>, which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case.
