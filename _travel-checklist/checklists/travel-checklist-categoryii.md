</ol>

&#9744;  <i><b>D) Application for Entry Visas</b></i>

### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

As part of the airline or transport operator’s pre-boarding checks, travellers may be asked for the following:
- Entry approval letter (only for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen or Permanent Resident); and

As part of immigration clearance, travellers will be asked for their PDT report showing a negative COVID-19 result. Failing which, they may be turned away, and/or have their entry/re-entry or work-related permits and passes cancelled. 

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests</b></i>

Take an on-arrival [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price) test. If you did not [pay for the test before arrival](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest#price), you will pay on the spot but can expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.

&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

A 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their [SGAC declaration](https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-depart/entry_requirements/sg-arrival-card). The SHN takes effect immediately on the day of its issuance.

The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses, street-hailed taxis) is prohibited. Travellers must rely on the same transport options when commuting from their SHN accommodation for the COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test that is administered on the last day of SHN. To guarantee a smooth journey, click [here](/health/faq#transport) for the relevant transport advisories.

### Stage 4: Self-isolation

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

A Stay-Home Notice (SHN) comes into effect immediately upon its issuance. Travellers must remain in the SHN accommodation for the period specified in their SHN, unless they have/have been:
- Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;
- Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; or
- Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken on the last day of SHN.

To calculate the estimated SHN end-date, click here for an SHN calculator. Travellers may complete their SHN at their own residence, self-sourced hotel, or serviced apartment. Travellers planning to serve their SHN at a self-sourced hotel should only secure their bookings after checking and ensuring that the hotel of choice can accommodate guests on SHN. Travellers may refer to [this page](https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation) for the non-exhaustive list of hotels offering SHN-accommodation.

During the SHN period, randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted. Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers can expect to be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. For more information on SHN-related compliance matters, click [here](/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks).

&#9744;  <i><b>B) COVID-19 Tests during SHN</b></i>

Travellers will be scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) on the last day of the SHN. Travellers who do not receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance in writing via [this form](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry).


### Stage 5: End of Self-isolation period

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice(SHN)</b></i>

Travellers can leave their SHN accommodation only after the end-of SHN COVID-19 test result is negative. The result of the test will be communicated to you via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the  [HealthHub App](https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices). 

Travellers who test positive for [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) will and must receive [medical treatment](/health/covidtreatment). The prevailing treatment charges will apply.

&#9744;  <i><b>B) Advisory on prevailing COVID-19 management in Singapore</b></i>

After SHN, travellers may go about their activities but must comply with the latest public health measures.This includes the use of the [TraceTogether app](https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/), which allows the identification of close contacts of a positive COVID-19 case. For the latest measures visit the Ministry of Health [website](https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory) for more details.

Some activities in Singapore may require proof of vaccination (e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions). If you had been vaccinated overseas, click [here](/health/vtsg) for details on whether you qualify, and how to receive local recognition as a “fully vaccinated traveller”.
