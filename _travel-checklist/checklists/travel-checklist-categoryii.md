Upon verification, the travellers’ vaccination status will be reflected in HealthHub or the TraceTogether application for 30 days, which can be used in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moh-smm" target="_blank">vaccination-differentiated settings</a>.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers should <b>defer their travels</b> if they:</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman">

</ol>


<div id="stage1e"></div>

&#9744;  <i><b>E) Registration and Pre-payment for On-Arrival COVID-19 Test [only for arrivals before 7 Jan 2022, 2359h]</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers who are fit for travel should <a href="https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/" target="_blank">register and pay</a> for the on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (S$125) required of those aged 3 and above this calendar year. Without advance booking, travellers can expect delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.</p>

&#9744;  <i><b>F) Installation of TraceTogether app</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers must install and activate <a href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg/" target="_blank">TraceTogether</a> mobile application on their mobile phones for contact tracing. Travellers aged 6 or below in this calendar year, and individuals who are unable to use a mobile device due to a certified disability/special need can obtain a <a href="/health/tt-for-travellers" target="_blank">TraceTogether token</a> after arrival in Singapore.</p>

&#9744;  <i><b>G) Secure Accommodation for Stay-Home Notice</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers must complete their 7-day Stay Home Notice (SHN) at a declared accommodation, which includes:</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:disc;">
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.35;">Place of residence;</li> 
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.35;">Serviced apartment; or</li>
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.35;">Hotel of choice from this <a href="https://sha.org.sg/hotel-accommodation" target="_blank">non-exhaustive list</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">For hotel bookings, travellers should check and ensure that the hotel can accommodate self-isolating guests waiting for their on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test ("PCR Test") result before a booking is made. During booking, they should indicate that they are serving self-isolation for the on-arrival test.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers may serve SHN at their residence with other household members, regardless of their household members' vaccination status or travel history. However, the following precautions are strongly advised:</p> 

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; padding-left: 30px; margin-top:20px; list-style-type: lower-latin;">
<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Isolate in their own room during the 7-day period;</li>
<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Minimise contact with any household members and avoid sharing bathrooms. If bathroom sharing cannot be avoided, all members in the household should:</li>
</ol>
<ol style="padding-left: 70px; margin-top:20px; list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Lower the lid before flushing the toilet;</li>
<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.35;">Clean and disinfect contact surfaces after each use; and</li>
<li style="padding-left: 20px; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px; line-height:1.35;">Avoid using the toilet after the self-isolating individual for at least 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>



### Stage 2: Departure for Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>Pre-boarding Document Checks</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">To ensure that the traveller is approved for entry into Singapore, travellers may be asked by the airline to produce the following during pre-boarding checks:</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Valid Entry Approval Letter (Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents are exempted); and</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Valid Pre-Departure Test showing a negative COVID-19 result (see Stage 1C)</li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers who fail to produce these documents may be denied boarding.</p>


### Stage 3: Arrival in Singapore

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Immigration Clearance and Registering Proof of Vaccination</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">During immigration clearance, provide all documents, including proof of tests, and information required by the immigration officer. Upon clearance, <b>air travellers</b> will receive an email, as provided in the SG Arrival Card (see Stage 1D), of their <b><a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/electronic-visit-pass-(e-pass)-replaces-inked-endorsements-for-foreign-visitors-arriving-in-singapore-via-air-checkpoints" target="_blank">e-Pass (i.e. Visit Pass)</a> which will state the period of stay granted</b>. Travellers who are cleared for entry via Land or Sea, will continue to have their passports physically endorsed.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.35;"><a href="/health/vtsg" target="_blank">Fully vaccinated travellers</a> who meet the following conditions <b>must clear immigration at the manual counters and request the immigration officer to register their vaccination details in their TraceTogether App</b> (see Stage 1E):</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-roman;">
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Aged 12 and above; </li>
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Do not possess a digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate, i.e. certificate with a QR code for verification; and</li>
			<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Possess the original vaccination document, stating the type and date(s) for which the vaccine was administered. All vaccination documents must be in English, or translated to English by a translation service provider, notary public or embassy of the country of document issuance. </li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Once registered, the traveller will be able to show proof of their vaccination status using the TraceTogether Application in <a href="https://go.gov.sg/moh-smm" target="_blank">vaccination-differentiated settings (e.g. malls, dining out)</a>. All registrations performed during immigration clearance are valid only for 30 days. Travellers staying in Singapore beyond 30 days, or those who had not registered their vaccination status during immigration clearance, should visit <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---post-vaccination-matters" target="_blank">MOH’s website</a> (under “Recognising Overseas Vaccination”) for more details.</p>

&#9744;  <i><b>B) On arrival COVID-19 Tests [only for arrivals before 7 Jan 2022, 2359h]</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Follow the instructions of officers on the ground and take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers who did not <a href="#stage1e" >pay for the test before arrival</a> (see Stage 1E), will do so on the spot and expect additional delays in the administration of the test and departure from the checkpoint.</p>


&#9744;  <i><b>C) Issuance of Stay Home Notice (SHN) </b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">A 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN), which takes effect immediately on the day of issuance, will be sent to the email address provided by the traveller in their SGAC declaration (see Stage 1D).</p>

<div id="stage3d"></div>

&#9744; <i><b>D) Transport to Declared SHN Accommodation</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Travellers must commute directly to their declared Stay-Home Notice (SHN) accommodation using private transport, taxis (including street-hailed taxis) or private-hire car (GrabSHN, Go-Jek, Ryde, MVL Tada). <a href="/health/faq#transport" target="_blank">Click here for the latest transport advisory</a>.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">The use of public transport (e.g. trains, buses) is prohibited.</p>


### Stage 4: Stay-Home Notice and COVID-19 Tests

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Serve Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">A 7-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) takes effect immediately upon its issuance, and travellers <b>must</b> remain in their declared SHN accommodation for the period specified in the SHN. To calculate the estimated SHN end date, click <a href="/shn-calculator" target="_blank">here</a> for an SHN calculator.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">Failure to comply with any SHN-related requirement is an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act. Errant travellers will first be issued an Electronic Monitoring Device (EMD) from ICA to ensure compliance. For subsequent breaches, travellers can be fined, imprisoned, and/or have their residency/work permits revoked. During the SHN period, <a href="/health/shn#shn-compliance-checks" target="_blank">randomised in-person or phone/video compliance check(s) will be conducted</a> (see advisory below), and travellers may only leave their SHN accommodation in the following cases:</p>

<ol style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-bottom:0px; list-style-type:lower-latin;">
	<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Directed by the relevant authorities to do so;</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Scheduled to take a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR test”) at the end of the SHN period; OR</li>
			<li style="padding-left: 20px; font-size:18px; margin-top:10px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35;">Received a negative PCR test result for the test taken before the end of the SHN.</li>
</ol>

<p style="line-height:1.35;">The transport arrangements stated at <a href="#stage3d">Stage 3D</a> will apply for scenarios (a) and (b), above. Travellers requiring essentials during the SHN period may opt for home delivery service or enlist the help of others. When collecting these items, avoid collecting them personally. For other SHN-related need, you may reach the SafeTravel Helpline at 6812 5555 (call charges apply) for assistance. </p>

<div style="padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top:15px; line-height:1.35; border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom:20px;">
	<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:20px; line-height:1.35; color:red;"><b>Anti-Scam Advisory</b></p> 
<p style="margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; line-height:1.35">All in-person or phone/video compliance checks are conducted by the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA), Ministry of Manpower (MOM) or the Ministry of Education (MOE). Authorised officers conducting house visits will produce their warrant cards or authorisation letters as proof of identify. For phone/video compliance checks, travellers will only be asked for the last four digits of their Identity Card or Travel Document for identity verification. Any request for payment or credit card details made over phone may be a scam. If you suspect you have received a scam call, please contact the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000.</p>
</div>

&#9744;  <i><b>B) End-of-SHN COVID-19 Test</b></i>

Travellers will be scheduled to take a mandatory COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (“PCR test”) before the end of their SHN. Payment for the test (S$125/test, including GST) for travellers who are not a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Singapore Permanent Resident (PR) is already collected during entry approval (see Stage 1A). For SC/PRs, the test payment details will be communicated separately after arrival in Singapore.

Travellers who fail to receive their test appointment details a day before the end of their SHN should seek for assistance using <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry" target="_blank">this form</a>. Travellers who are unwell on the day of the test should remain in their accommodation and <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tc" target="_blank">alert the relevant agencies</a>.



### Stage 5: End of Stay-Home Notice

&#9744;  <i><b>A) Release from Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</b></i>

The SHN will end after the traveller receives a negative test result (per Stage 4B) or upon completion of the 7-day SHN, whichever is later. The result of the test will be communicated via a call, email, or SMS about 24 hours from when the test was administered. Travellers with Singpass may also view their results via the <a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/HealtheServices" target="_blank">HealthHub App</a>.

Travellers who test positive for COVID-19 will and must receive <a href="/health/insurance-and-treatment#treatment" target="_blank">medical treatment</a>, and the prevailing treatment charges will apply.


&#9744;  <i><b>B) Abide by local COVID-19 safe management measures</b></i>

Travellers may go about their activities while complying with the <a href="https://moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory" target="_blank">latest public health measures</a>. This includes the use of TraceTogether, to facilitate the identification of close contacts of a COVID-positive case.

For vaccination-differentiated settings, e.g. attendance at large scale events, dining restrictions, travellers will be required to produce proof of vaccination. Travellers who have registered their vaccination status on their TraceTogether application may do so using the app (see Stage 3A). Travellers who require vaccinated status beyond 30 days after arrival, should visit 
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---post-vaccination-matters" target="_blank">MOH’s website</a> (under “Recognising Overseas Vaccination”) for more details.
