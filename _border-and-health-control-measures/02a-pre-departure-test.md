## **Application for Pre-Departure COVID-19 PCR Test**

This application is for travellers who wish to apply for a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. 

Travellers who have received approval to travel under Singapore’s Green/Fast Lane arrangements with other countries or who hold a My TravelPass under the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) with Malaysia <u>need not apply</u> as they are already eligible to book a pre-departure test as part of the RGL approvals.

All other travellers must apply to be eligible for a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. Clinics and testing centres will not administer the test unless approval has been granted.

The cost of the PCR test is to be borne by the applicant.

**From 1 December 2020, Government approval is no longer required for pre-departure COVID-19 PCR tests.**
