Multiple COVID-19 test kits and methodologies exist in the market today. However, in the context of travel, Singapore relies on two types of tests, below, to detect and monitor the transmission of COVID-19.

 1. COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”)
 2. Serology/Serological Test
 
 A pre-departure test may also be required for entry into Singapore or to a destination country/region.

### COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”)

The COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) is regarded worldwide to as the most accurate and reliable test to detect active COVID-19 infections. A PCR test is generally administered by a trained professional who will take a swab sample from the nose and/or throat of a traveller. In Singapore’s context, all inbound travellers aged 7 and above, including those who had recovered from COVID-19, will be PCR-tested before and/or upon arrival.
