SHNs are legal notices issued under Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act, to require a person to remain at their place of residence or Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility ([SDF](#sdf)) at all times for a stipulated period. Any breach in the SHN requirements is punishable under Singapore laws, which can amount to an imprisonment term and/or fine. Additional punitive measures such as the cancellation of the work pass could also be taken by the relevant authorities.

Depending on the travellers’ travel history and safe travel lane used to enter Singapore, travellers may be issued with a 7 or 14-day SHN with a mandatory [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test](/health/covid19-tests) conducted towards the end of the SHN.

Requirements for SHN or COVID-19 PCR tests are specific to individual [Safe Travel Lanes](/arriving/overview). Travellers should note that the SHN comes into effect immediately on the day of its issuance. The SHN will end at 12 pm, 7 or 14 days after arrival. See examples below:
