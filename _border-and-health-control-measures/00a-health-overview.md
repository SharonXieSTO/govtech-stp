### Overview

Singapore is reopening its borders in a controlled and safe manner to maintain its status as an international hub. To minimise the public health risks associated with the border reopening, all travellers may be required to observe the relevant health control measures, below:

<u>COVID-19 Tests</u>
- COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“PCR Test”)
- Serology Test
- Pre-departure test 

<u>Self-Isolation and Segregation Measures</u>
- Stay-Home Notice (SHN)
- SHN in Dedicated Facilities (SDF)
- SHN Electronic Monitoring Devices

As these measures are continually evolving to better respond to the epidemiological developments overseas, travellers planning to visit Singapore should visit the [Ministry of Health’s (MOH)](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) webpage for the latest information.

Travellers approved for entry should refer to the specific requirements and process for the respective Safe Travel lanes they are entering Singapore on. These health control requirements would also be stated as conditions of entry approval where relevant.
