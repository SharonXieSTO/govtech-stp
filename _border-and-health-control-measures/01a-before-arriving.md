## Pre-Departure to Singapore

### 1. Obtain Entry Approval

With the exception of Singapore citizens and permanent residents, all travellers must obtain an entry approval to enter Singapore. Approvals can be obtained from the relevant government agencies (e.g. MOE, MOM), or via the application for a Safe Travel pass (details [here](/arriving/overview). Travellers without an entry approval will be denied entry and may have their existing work passes revoked.

If unsure which entry lanes and health requirements are applicable to you to enter Singapore depending on your country of departure and traveller type, please click [here](/arriving/overview) to find out more.

### 2. Apply for Visa (If Applicable)

Travellers who require a [visa](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa) to enter Singapore should submit their visa applications after they have obtained the requisite entry approvals under the prevailing border control measure. Those previously issued with visas, which had been suspended due to COVID-19 and are still valid, do not need to apply for a new visa. 

Click [here](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/save) to check if your visa remains valid.

A requisite entry approval as well as a valid visa must be obtained prior to travelling to and seeking entry into Singapore.

### 3. COVID-19 Test before departing for Singapore (If Applicable)

Depending on the travellerâ€™s scheme of travel (e.g. Reciprocal Green Lane), he/she may be required to take a COVID-19 PCR test before departing for Singapore. Whether a traveller needs to be tested before departing for Singapore is set out in the Terms and Conditions of the Safe Travel passes governing entry into Singapore.

#### For Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident

Upon arrival, travellers are obligated to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at the dedicated SHN facilities and take a COVID-19 PCR test before completing their SHN. The payment required will be communicated by the SHN facilities during the stay and travellers are required to pay the charges upfront when checking into the SHN facility. Failure to do so may result in late payment interests being charged.

#### For Non-Singapore Citizen or Non-Singapore Permanent Resident (Including Children aged 12 years old and below)

Travellers will be required to take a COVID-19 PCR Test within 72 hours before departure for Singapore, if he/she
- Has recent travel history to any [countries/places/regions](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) (as indicated in S/N 4 & 5 of the table) <u>within the last 14 days prior to entry into Singapore would require a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN)</u>.

Travellers must present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test result, in English and from recognised laboratories, to enter Singapore. The test result **must** contain the following details:
- Date the test was taken
- Test Result
- Particulars of Traveller as indicated in the passport (Name and Date of Birth or Passport Number).  

Upon arrival, travellers are also obligated to serve a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at the dedicated SHN facilities and take another COVID-19 PCR test before completing their SHN. The payment required will be communicated by the SHN facilities during the stay and travellers are required to pay the charges upfront when checking into the SHN facility. Failure to do so may result in late payment interests being charged.

### 4. Application for opting out of Dedicated Stay-Home Notice (SHN) Facility

Travellers from this list of [countries/regions](/files/SHN-and-swab-summary.pdf) (as indicated in S/N 4 of the table) may opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:

- Travelled to no other country/region/place than the above mentioned countries/regions/places, in the last consecutive 14 days prior to departure for Singapore;
- Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members with the same travel history, who are also serving their SHN of the same duration and period; and
- There is no one ordinarily residing at the place of residence (e.g. domestic helper) who does not share the same travel history, and the traveller has already made all necessary arrangements to ensure that any such person will not reside at the place of residence until the conclusion of the SHN period.

Applications must be made at least three days prior to arrival in Singapore. Applications can be submitted [here](/sc-pr/opt-out/apply-now) for Singapore citizens (SC) and permanent residents (PRs). Non SCs or PRs may apply to opt out as part of the entry approval process.

The list of countries/regions eligible for opt-out of dedicated SHN facilities will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment. Travellers must be prepared that any prior approvals given for opt-out from dedicated SHN facilities may be revoked, and the prevailing border measures upon entry will apply, including stay in SHN dedicated facility and payment, where applicable.

### 5. Submission of Health Declaration

All travellers must submit a pre-trip health and travel history declaration via the <a href="https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/" target="_blank">SG Arrival Card (SGAC) e-Service</a> 3 days before arrival in Singapore.
