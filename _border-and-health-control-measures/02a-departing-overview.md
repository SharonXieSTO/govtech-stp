  <b><span style="color:red">IMPORTANT NOTICE</span> </b> <br/> <br/>
<span style="font-size:16px; line-height:1.0; color:red;">On 28 December 2020, Indonesia announced a temporary ban on the entry of all foreign nationals into Indonesia from 1 to 14 January 2021. The Indonesian government has notified MFA that this ban would also apply to foreign nationals travelling to Indonesia under all of Indonesiaâ€™s Travel Corridor Arrangements (TCA) with other countries. Hence, Singapore residents would not be able to travel from Singapore to Indonesia under the Singapore-Indonesia Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) / TCA during this period. Given the reciprocal nature of this travel arrangement, travellers will also not be able to apply to travel from Indonesia to Singapore under the Singapore-Indonesia RGL / TCA during this period. Travellers who have already received approval to enter Singapore under the Singapore-Indonesia RGL / TCA can continue to do so. The full statement from MFA on this matter can be found here (link).
