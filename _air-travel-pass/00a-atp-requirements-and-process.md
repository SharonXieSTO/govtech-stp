### **2. ATP Application**

**Preparation of application**

Travellers must have on hand the following:
- Passport details;
- Intended date of entry into Singapore;
- Address of Traveller’s accommodation to complete their on-arrival swab isolation; and
- Contact details in Singapore (e.g. Name, Mobile Number, Email Address)

**ATP application**
Travellers can apply for the ATP [here](/atp/apply-now).

Visitors must comply with the [Conditions](/atp/conditions) of the Air Travel Pass, and the prevailing immigration requirements of the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) for their entry and stay in Singapore. When the Air Travel Pass application is approved, an approval letter will be sent to the applicant via email.

Visitors who do not meet the Air Travel Pass conditions may be refused entry into Singapore and/or have their Air Travel Pass cancelled. In such an event, visitors may also be liable for the cost of their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation. In addition, their future Air Travel Pass applications may also be rejected.

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may, at their own discretion, introduce new measures or requirements to safeguard public health. This may include changes to the conditions or cancellation of the Air Travel Pass at short notice. Visitors will be notified of changes to the conditions or cancellation of their Air Travel Passes.

For ATP application enquiries, please email <COVID_ATP_Enquiries@caas.gov.sg>.


### **3. Before Travelling to Singapore**

#### Apply for Visa if Required

Visitors who hold a visa-required passport must separately obtain a valid visa prior to departure for Singapore. Such visitors are strongly encouraged to apply for their Air Travel Pass early.

If the visitor already has an existing valid visa which has been suspended due to COVID-19, ICA will lift the suspension and there is no need to obtain a new visa. Information on visa requirements and application can be found on ICA’s [website](https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa).

#### Pre-Departure Requirements

**Health Requirements**

Prior to departing for Singapore, a visitor holding an Air Travel Pass must:
- remain in the ATP-eligible country/region for at least 14 consecutive days before departing for Singapore;
- monitor his/her health status before departure;
- book an accommodation in Singapore to serve out his/her isolation period for 1-2 days while waiting for his/her post-arrival COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result<sup>1</sup>. The accommodation<sup>2</sup> must be non-residential and must be an individual room with an attached toilet. Click [here](https://www.sha.org.sg/) for a list of hotels currently accepting ATP-approved travellers.

**Payment for Swab**

Travellers are also strongly encouraged to [register and pre-pay](https://safetravel.changiairport.com/#/) for their post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore. If the traveller is unable to make pre-payment before departing for Singapore, please ensure that he/she has a mobile phone with an activated line upon arrival, as on-site payment would typically require an OTP being sent to a registered mobile line. 

**Present Documents for Departure**

When checking in at the departure airport, the visitor must present to the airline staff:
- a valid Air Travel Pass approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the specified period of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded.

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused boarding by the airline.

**Health Declaration**

The approved traveller will have to electronically submit pre-trip health and travel history declarations and declare his/her accommodation in Singapore via the [SG Arrival Card e-service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/), before departing for Singapore. The SG Arrival Card can also be accessed via the [Visit Singapore Travel Guide App](https://www.visitsingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/visit-singapore-travel-guide-app/).

### **4. Arrival in Singapore**

**Immigration Checks**

At arrival immigration in Singapore, the visitor must present to the ICA officer:
- a valid Air Travel Pass approval letter (electronic or physical copy) for the specified period of entry into Singapore;
- a valid visa (for visa-required passport holders); and
- a mobile device with the TraceTogether app downloaded.

A visitor who does not have any of the above may be refused entry into Singapore by ICA.

**Transport to Accomodation**

A visitor holding an Air Travel Pass will undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport upon arrival in Singapore. After undergoing the test, the visitor must take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car to travel from the airport to his/her declared accommodation and remain in isolation at that accommodation until he/she is notified that his/her test result is negative. The visitor shall also bear any transportation and accommodation costs incurred.

If the visitor tests negative for COVID-19, the visitor can leave his/her accommodation and go about his/her activities in Singapore. Visitors must be responsible for their medical bills should they require medical treatment including for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

### **5. Stay in Singapore**

Visitors must adhere to the prevailing public health measures during their stay in Singapore, which include wearing of masks and safe distancing.

To facilitate contact tracing, visitors must keep the TraceTogether app activated on their mobile devices while in Singapore. 

### **6. Departure from Singapore**

Travellers are required to retain the TraceTogether app with the data for 14 consecutive days after leaving Singapore. A visitor must upload all data in the TraceTogether app upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health should he/she test positive for COVID-19 while in Singapore or in the first 14 days after leaving Singapore.
