## Overview 

The Air Travel Pass (ATP) schemes address the needs of different groups of cross-border travellers between Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Mainland China, New Zealand, Vietnam  and Singapore.

The ATP scheme enables short-term visitors from the above-mentioned countries entry into Singapore. Short-term visitors under the ATP scheme are required to apply for an ATP, and comply with the conditions of the ATP. These include undergoing a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore, in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice (SHN), and downloading and using TraceTogether for their entire period of stay.
