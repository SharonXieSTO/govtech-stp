### **Air Travel Pass (ATP)**

#### 1. What is an ATP?

An ATP allows visitors<sup>1</sup> travelling from Australia to seek entry into Singapore.

The ATP comes with conditions of travel that the applicant must comply with.

#### 2. When can visitors start applying for an ATP?

Visitors travelling from Australia (excluding Victoria State) can apply for an ATP from 1 October 2020, 1200hrs, Singapore time (GMT +8), for entry into Singapore from 8 October 2020, 0001hrs. 

Visitors travelling from Australia (Victoria State) can apply for an ATP from 30 October 2020, 1200hrs, Singapore time (GMT +8), for entry into Singapore from 6 November 2020, 0001hrs. 

#### 3. How can visitors apply for an ATP?

Applications for the ATP can be made between seven and thirty calendar days prior to the intended date of entry into Singapore.

For example, visitors who intend to enter Singapore on 31 October 2020 must apply for an ATP between 1 October 2020 and 24 October 2020.

#### 4. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 5. Is there a fee to apply for an ATP?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of an ATP.

#### 6. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 7. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

If submitting multiple ATP applications, visitors should ensure that the intended date of entry into Singapore for each application is at least 7 calendar days apart. This is because an ATP is valid from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to 7 calendar days after. Otherwise, only the application with the latest intended date of entry will be processed and the rest rejected.

#### 8. How long is the validity of an ATP?

An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

For example, visitors who hold a valid ATP to enter Singapore on 1 November 2020, have up to 8 November to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 9. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

#### 10. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by ICA at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Please note that the ATP is **not** an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period. 

#### 11. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is no guarantee that an extension will be granted.

#### 12. Do Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders need to apply for an Air Travel Pass?

No, Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an ATP. However, Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

For information on border control measures, please refer to the Singapore Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) website [here](/health).

#### 13. Can travel agents apply for an Air Travel Pass on behalf of their clients?

No. Visitors will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the ATP, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

#### 14. Why was my ATP application rejected? 

An ATP application may be rejected for reasons such as:
- Incomplete and/or incorrect information submitted
- Duplicate applications
- Duplicate mobile number submitted
*[Note: Each visitor must provide his/her own mobile number and remain contactable at that number throughout his/her stay in Singapore, with the exception of those below 18 years old.]*
- Multiple applications with intended dates of entry that are less than 7 days apart
*[Note: If submitting multiple ATP applications, visitors should ensure that the intended date of entry into Singapore for each application is at least 7 calendar days apart. This is because an ATP is valid from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to 7 calendar days after.]*

### **Visa Application**

#### 15. Do visitors with a valid ATP need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa for travel to Singapore, must separately obtain a valid visa after receiving their ATP approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.  

Visitors may refer to ICA website (<https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa>) for information on visa requirements and application.

### **ATP Conditions of Travel**

#### 16. What are the ATP conditions of travel?

Visitors must comply with the ATP Conditions [here](/australia/atp/conditions).

#### 17. Why must visitors take direct flights without transit to Singapore?

This is to protect public health in Singapore by ensuring that visitors are not travelling to Singapore via a country with high virus prevalence rates.

### **Post-Arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test**

#### 18. Are visitors required to take a post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Upon arrival in Singapore, visitors must undergo a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at the airport, in lieu of a Stay-Home Notice. The test results will be out within 48 hours.

After taking the COVID-19 PCR test, visitors are to take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their declared place of accommodation. They must remain isolated at the accommodation until the test result is confirmed to be negative. After being notified of their negative test results, visitors will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.

#### 19. What types of accommodation do visitors need to use while waiting for their test results?

The accommodation must be non-residential and must be an individual room with an attached toilet.

Visitors are required to bear the cost of their accommodation in Singapore.

Visitors may refer to the Singapore Hotel Association (SHA) [website](https://sha.org.sg/) for a list of hotels currently accepting visitors travelling to Singapore under the Green Lane or Air Travel Pass. The list is non-exhaustive and visitors may book other available accommodation as long as these are non-residential. Please note that visitors must stay in individual rooms with an attached toilet.

#### 20. Can visitors share the same room with family members / travel companions / a caretaker (due to a certified disability or special needs) while waiting for their PCR test results?

Yes, while waiting for their PCR test results, visitors are allowed to share the same room with their family members, travel companions or a caretaker, if they share similar travel history in the past 14 days prior to departure for Singapore.

Please also note that if the visitor's test result is confirmed to be positive, all persons who had shared the same room with the visitor, as well as those identified to be a close contact, will be issued a Quarantine Order by the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH).

#### 21. Do children need to undergo a post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year are not required to undergo a post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test. However, children whose close contacts are found to be tested positive for COVID-19 will be required to take the test.

#### 23. What happens if visitors refuse to undergo the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test?

If visitors refuse to undergo the post-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, they may be refused entry into Singapore and have their ATP cancelled. In such an event, visitors may also be liable for all costs incurred for their repatriation, including custody and maintenance pending repatriation.

#### 24. Can my company / family member / friend pick me up from the airport in a private vehicle and transport me to my declared place of accommodation where I will be waiting for my COVID-19 PCR test results?

Visitors entering Singapore on an approved Air Travel Pass may be picked up from the airport by their company / family member / friend in a private vehicle. There should not be more than one person picking the visitor up from the airport. 

Visitors must be transported directly to their declared place of accommodation to await their COVID-19 PCR test results. All persons in the private vehicle must wear face masks throughout the journey. The following precautionary measures are also strongly encouraged:
- The visitor should sit alone in the back seat and the front passenger seat should be left unoccupied.
- If more than one visitor is picked up, visitors sharing the same vehicle should have the same travel history and head to the same declared accommodation.
- The vehicle windows should be wound down and the air-conditioning turned off, where practical.
- After the visitor has been dropped off at his/her declared accommodation, the driver should wipe down the vehicle. Please refer to the National Environment Agency (NEA) [guidelines](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/cleaning-and-disinfection/advisories/advisory-on-surface-cleaning-and-disinfection-for-covid-19) for surface cleaning and disinfection.

### **Contact Tracing – TraceTogether App**

#### 25. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track visitors’ movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby mobile devices running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s mobile device, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

#### 26. Must every visitor download the TraceTogether app?

Yes, all visitors to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app. They must do so prior to departing for Singapore.

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year and travelling with a parent/guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with a certified disability or special need are also exempted.

#### 27. After downloading the TraceTogether app, how do I activate it? 

After downloading the TraceTogether app, you need to activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You will need to verify your mobile number with an SMS One-Time Password and register your profile on the app with the passport number you have submitted for your ATP application. For more information, please refer to the TraceTogether [website](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735573-How-do-I-set-up-the-TraceTogether-App-).

If you require assistance on how to download and activate the TraceTogether app, please email <support@tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 28. If I change my mobile device on SIM card when I arrive in Singapore, do I need to download the TraceTogether app again?

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You must also retain your previous mobile device with the TraceTogether app up to 14 days after departure from Singapore. This is because the TraceTogether app data stored in your previous mobile device also needs to be retained for that duration, as set out in the ATP [Condition](/australia/atp/conditions) 1(e)(ii).

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

Please ensure that you keep your mobile device's Bluetooth function turned on so that the TraceTogether app renains activated throughout your stay in Singapore.

#### 29. What happens if visitors do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app?

Visitors, with mobile devices that are unable to download the TraceTogether app, can rent a compatible mobile device from the Changi Recommends website [here](https://www.changirecommends.com/reservation_form.aspx) prior to departing for Singapore. They must have an electronic or physical copy of the booking confirmation from Changi Recommends to present to the airline staff during check-in at the departure airport. Visitors who are unable to present a booking confirmation may be refused boarding by the airline.

Visitors can pay for and collect their rental mobile device at the Changi Recommends booth in Changi Airport prior to clearing arrival immigration. Upon collection, they must download the TraceTogether app and immediately register their profile on the app with their Singapore mobile number and the same passport number submitted for their ATP application. At immigration clearance, visitors are to present their mobile device with the TraceTogether app already downloaded and registered. Those who are unable to do so may be denied entry into Singapore by ICA.

Visitors, who have rented a mobile device from Changi Recommends, must carry it with them at all times during their stay in Singapore until it is returned to Changi Recommends. If you change to another mobile device during your stay in Singapore, you must download and activate the TraceTogether app on that device. You must also retain the app on that device for the rest of your stay and for 14 consecutive days after departing Singapore.   
Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year and travelling with parent/guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with a certified disability or special need are also exempted.
