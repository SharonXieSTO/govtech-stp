### IMPORTANT NOTICE: SUSPENSION OF AIR TRAVEL PASS FOR HONG KONG

Given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, Singapore will tighten border measures for travellers with travel history to Hong Kong within the last 7 days before departure for Singapore.

### Short-term Visitors

**Short-term visitors with travel history to Hong Kong, within the last 7 days before departure for Singapore**, will not be allowed to enter Singapore with effect from **24 February 2022, 2359hrs (Singapore time)**. Please refer to the press release <a href="https://www.caas.gov.sg/who-we-are/newsroom/Detail/singapore-restores-and-extends-vaccinated-travel-lane/">here</a> issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)  dated 16 February 2022.
	
With immediate effect, applications for the ATP for short-term visitors travelling from Hong Kong will be suspended until further notice.

### Vaccinated Travel Lane

From 25 February 2022, fully vaccinated travellers departing from Hong Kong may enter Singapore without the need to serve SHN under a new Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangement. For more information on the VTL, please refer <a href="/vtl/requirements-and-process">here</a>.

### Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents/Long-Term Pass Holders

Short term visitors with SC/PR family in Singapore and who need to enter Singapore for extenuating reasons can do so via the [SC/PR Familial Ties Lane](/scpr-familial-ties-lane/overview). 

SC, PR and Long-Term Pass holders entering Singapore with travel history to Hong Kong within the last 7 days before departure for Singapore, will be subject to an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test, a 7-day SHN at their place of residence, and a COVID-19 PCR test before the end of the SHN period.
