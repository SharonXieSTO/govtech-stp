### **Air Travel Pass (ATP)**

#### 1. What is an ATP?

An ATP allows short-term visitors<sup>1</sup> travelling from Hong Kong to seek entry into Singapore under the Air Travel Bubble arrangement.

The ATP comes with conditions of travel that the applicant must comply with.

#### 2. When can visitors start applying for an ATP?

Visitors can apply for an ATP from 12 November 2020, 0800hrs, Singapore time (GMT +8), for entry into Singapore on or after 22 November 2020.

#### 3. How can visitors apply for an ATP?

Applications for the ATP can be made between 7 and 30 calendar days prior to the intended date of entry into Singapore.

For example, visitors who intend to enter Singapore on 31 December 2020 must apply for an ATP between 1 December 2020 and 24 December 2020.

#### 4. How long will it take for an ATP application to be processed?

We will endeavour to get back to the applicant within three working days.

#### 5. Is there a fee to apply for an ATP?

No, there is no fee payable for the application of an ATP.

#### 6. Do visitors travelling with family members need to apply an ATP for every individual?

Yes, each visitor will require an ATP. In the case of a minor (below 18 years old), consent must be given by the parent or guardian for the application.

#### 7. Is there a limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP?

There is no limit to the number of times visitors can apply for an ATP. Every entry into Singapore requires a new ATP application.

#### 8. How long is the validity of an ATP?

An ATP is valid for single entry into Singapore anytime from the visitor’s intended date of entry and up to seven calendar days after.

For example, visitors who hold a valid ATP to enter Singapore on 1 December 2020, have up to 8 December 2020 to do so should they need to make changes to their flight departure date.

#### 9. Once an ATP application is approved, can the relevant authorities change the conditions of travel or even cancel the ATP?

Given the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevant authorities in Singapore may introduce new measures or requirements as and when necessary to safeguard public health. This may result in changes to the conditions or cancellation of the ATP at short notice. Applicants will be notified of any such changes or cancellation of their ATP.

#### 10. How long can visitors stay in Singapore?

Visitors who are granted entry into Singapore will be issued with a visit pass by ICA at the immigration checkpoints. The duration of stay in Singapore will be generally aligned to that accorded to the passport holder prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Please note that the ATP is **not** an immigration visit pass. It only allows visitors to travel to and seek entry into Singapore within a specified period. 

#### 11. Are visitors able to extend their duration of stay in Singapore?

All applications for extension of visit pass must be submitted online using ICA’s e-service (<https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/esvclandingpage/extend>) at least seven days prior to the expiry of the visit pass to avoid overstaying. Each application will be considered on its own merits and there is **no** guarantee that an extension will be granted.

#### 12. Do Singapore Citizens / Permanent Residents / Long-Term Pass holders need to apply for an Air Travel Pass?

No, Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass holders are not required to apply for an ATP to travel from Hong Kong to Singapore under the Air Travel Bubble (ATB) arrangement. However, Long-Term Pass holders will still have to seek entry approval from the relevant Singapore Government agencies before travelling to Singapore.

There is no need to undergo a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test in Hong Kong for those travelling on non-designated flights.

#### 13. Can travel agents apply for an Air Travel Pass on behalf of their clients?

No. Visitors will need to submit the application themselves as they are required to agree to the conditions of the ATP, read and agree to the Privacy Statement, as well as verify all submitted information.

### **Visa Application**

#### 14. Do visitors with a valid ATP need to apply separately for a visa to enter Singapore?

Visitors, who require a visa for travel to Singapore, must separately obtain a valid visa after receiving their ATP approval and before departing for Singapore.

If visitors have already been issued with visas that are still valid or if they are eligible for the visa-free transit facility, they do not need to apply for a visa.  

Visitors may refer to ICA website (<https://www.ica.gov.sg/visitor/visitor_entryvisa>) for information on visa requirements and application.

### **ATP Conditions of Travel**

#### 17. Am I guaranteed a flight ticket on a designated flight from Hong Kong to Singapore if I have an ATP?

Having an ATP does **not** guarantee visitors a flight ticket on a designated flight from Hong Kong to Singapore. Visitors are responsible for obtaining their own flight tickets. Similarly, having a flight ticket on a designated flight from Hong Kong to Singapore does **not** guarantee an ATP.

#### 18. I have an ATP and a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result certificate, and I meet the travel history condition of the ATP, but I did not manage to get a flight ticket on a designated flight from Hong Kong to Singapore. Will I still be allowed to enter Singapore?

As set out in ATP [Conditions](/hongkong/atp/conditions), an ATP holder must travel from Hong Kong to Singapore on a flight designated by the Singapore Government and the Hong Kong Government.

If you are not travelling on a designated flight from Hong Kong to Singapore, you will not be allowed to enter Singapore.

#### 19. Why must visitors take designated ATB flights from Hong Kong to Singapore?

The number of visitors travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore is subject to a quota as a start, to allow for the reopening of cross-border air travel in a safe and progressive manner.

The quota is allocated to designated ATB flights, which have been agreed between the Singapore Government and Hong Kong Government under the Air Travel Bubble arrangement. This is to maintain control of cross-border passenger flows between Hong Kong and Singapore from the public health and epidemic control perspective.

### **Pre-Departure COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Test**

#### 20. Are visitors required to take a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test in Hong Kong?

Visitors must undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of their designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore and be tested negative for COVID-19.

For example, if the scheduled departure date and time of the visitor’s designated ATB flight is 30 November 2020, 1030hrs, the test must be taken no earlier than 27 November 2020, 1030hrs.

The pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test must be taken at one of the testing institutions in Hong Kong recognised by the Hong Kong Government. The list of recognised testing institutions can be found [here](https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/pdf/List_of_recognised_laboratories_RTPCR.pdf). The test result certificate must be in English and state the following:
- Visitor’s name, date of birth, and passport number, as indicated in his/her passport;
- a negative COVID-19 PCR test result;
- the date and time when the COVID-19 PCR test was taken; and
- the name of the testing institution where the COVID-19 PCR test was taken.

Visitors are responsible for making their own appointments with the testing institutions to take their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. They must also bear the cost of their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. Please check with the listed [testing institutions](https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/pdf/List_of_recognised_laboratories_RTPCR.pdf) for the cost of the test.

Visitors, who are unable to produce a valid pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result certificate during check-in at the departure airport in Hong Kong, may be refused boarding by the airline. 

#### 21. Do children need to undergo a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test?

Children aged 12 years old or younger in that calendar year are not required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore.

#### 22. Are visitors allowed to take a COVID-19 PCR test upon arrival in Singapore instead of a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test in Hong Kong?

No. Without a valid pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test result certificate, visitors will be refused boarding by the airline staff at the departure airport in Hong Kong.

### **Accommodation in Singapore**

#### 23. What types of accommodation are visitors travelling from Hong Kong allowed to stay in while in Singapore?

There are no restrictions on the type of accommodation that visitors can stay in while in Singapore. Visitors may stay in a hotel or a residential accommodation

Visitors may refer to the Singapore Tourism Board’s website [here](https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/approved-hotels.html) for a list of hotels currently accepting visitors travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore under the ATB. The list is non-exhaustive and visitors may book other available accommodation.

### **Contact Tracing – TraceTogether App**

#### 24. What is the TraceTogether app? Does the Singapore Government track visitors’ movements via the app?

The TraceTogether app supports nationwide efforts to combat COVID-19 by enabling community-driven contact tracing. It facilitates the contact tracing process by exchanging Bluetooth signals with nearby mobile devices running the same app. The proximity data collected allows the identification of people who were in close contact with an infected person more efficiently. The proximity data collected is stored locally in the user’s mobile device, and is only shared with the Singapore Ministry of Health if the user tests positive for COVID-19. The TraceTogether app does not collect or track location data.

#### 25. Must every visitor download the TraceTogether app?

Yes, all visitors to Singapore must download the TraceTogether app. They must do so prior to departing for Singapore.

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year and travelling with a parent/guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with a certified disability or special need are also exempted.

#### 26. After downloading the TraceTogether app, how do I activate it? 

After downloading the TraceTogether app, you need to activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You should register your profile on the app with the same passport number you have submitted for your ATP application. For more information, please refer to the TraceTogether [website](https://support.tracetogether.gov.sg/hc/en-sg/articles/360043735573-How-do-I-set-up-the-TraceTogether-App-).

If you require assistance on how to download and activate the TraceTogether app, please email <support@tracetogether.gov.sg>.

#### 27. If I change my mobile device on SIM card when I arrive in Singapore, do I need to download the TraceTogether app again?

If you change your mobile device, you are required to download the TraceTogether app again on your new mobile device and activate it by following the instructions that appear when you launch the app. You must also retain your previous mobile device with the TraceTogether app up to 14 days after departure from Singapore. This is because the TraceTogether app data stored in your previous mobile device also needs to be retained for that duration, as set out in the ATP [Condition](/hongkong/atp/conditions) 1(e)(ii).

If you change your SIM card but are still using the same mobile device, you will not need to download the TraceTogether app again.

Please ensure that you keep your mobile device's Bluetooth function turned on so that the TraceTogether app renains activated throughout your stay in Singapore.

#### 28. What happens if visitors do not have mobile devices to download the TraceTogether app?

All visitors must have a mobile device to download the TraceTogether app. They are responsible for ensuring that their mobile devices are compatible with the TraceTogether app, and may be refused boarding and entry into Singapore if they are unable to download the TraceTogether app on their mobile devices.

Children  aged  12 or younger in that calendar year and travelling with parent/guardian are exempted from this requirement. Visitors with a certified disability or special need are also exempted.

#### 29. Can visitors switch off their mobile devices while in Singapore?

No, visitors must keep their mobile devices and the Bluetooth function switched on at all times while in Singapore.

#### 30. Can visitors uninstall the TraceTogether app upon departing from Singapore?

Visitors must retain the TraceTogether app with the data on their mobile devices for 14 consecutive days after departing from Singapore. This is to facilitate contact tracing if visitors are tested positive for COVID-19.

#### 31. What happens if I test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore?

Should ATP visitors test positive for COVID-19 in Singapore, they will be accorded the necessary medical treatment.

Such visitors are required to bear the full cost of medical treatment, tests and isolation imposed on them for public health reasons. They will also need to upload all data in the TraceTogether app for contact tracing purposes upon request by the Singapore Ministry of Health (MOH).

### **Departing from Singapore**
