As a condition for entry into Singapore, pass holders with an approval under the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL) must comply with the prevailing travel health control measures (e.g. Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and COVID-19 tests). Employers and employment agencies, which submitted the entry applications (“Submitters”), must pay for pass holders’ entry charges and ensure they comply with the measures. 

For Construction, Marine shipyard or Process sector workers who meet <b>all of these conditions</b>, please refer to [Ministry of Manpower’s website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/entry-approval-requirements) for their travel health control measures:
- Hold Work Permit, Training Work Permit or S Pass, or in-principle approval for any of these 3 passes
- Not entering Singapore with their dependants

For all other pass holders (work pass holders and their dependants), please refer to this page for their travel health control measures. The control measures vary based on the pass holders’ travel history and will be stated on their entry approval letters. As the measures are subject to change based on the global situation, please refer to the table below for the latest requirements.
