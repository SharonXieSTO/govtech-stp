### General Queries

#### 1. I had applied for an Entry Approval under the Work Pass Holder General Lane but was not informed of the application outcome. What should I do?

Applicants should note that all applications will only be processed after payment is made. Depending on your email settings, the approval letter may be found in your spam or junk folder. Should you have difficulties locating the approval letter please write in with details of your application (e.g. application reference number, FIN and FIN expiry of your employee) to the following channels: 
- If you applied via the SafeTravel Portal, write in using the SafeTravel enquiries form ([here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry)) for assistance.
- If you applied directly with MOM, please write to MOM [here](https://service2.mom.gov.sg/efeedback/Forms/efeedback.aspx) for assistance.

#### 2. My employee plans to leave Singapore for a short personal trip. How should I advise them?

Employers may highlight to their employees that the travel restrictions implemented worldwide to curb the spread of [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) could affect flight availability and their ability to return to Singapore for work promptly. They will also be subject to the prevailing health measures on return. Additionally, the Singapore Government no longer covers the relevant medical costs for all new and existing pass holders who develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival in Singapore (press release [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers).

#### 3. My employee has been approved for entry into Singapore under the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL) .However, he/she is unable to enter Singapore on the date specified in the application, or I no longer wish to bring them in. What should I do? 

To bring your employee into Singapore on another date, please submit a new entry application for him/her to enter Singapore on another date. 

For us to consider a refund of the entry approval charges for the previous application, please submit a request to cancel the entry approval:

In general, all pre-payments made for the cost of the Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF) stay and COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”) are non-refundable. This is to cover the relevant cost incurred for securing and preparing the SDF for the traveller. A refund can be considered subject to MOM’s assessment.

#### 5. My employee has recently recovered from COVID-19. Can I bring them into Singapore immediately?

Please refer to the FAQ on recovered travellers [here](/health/faq#recovered).

#### 6. I am an employer of a Foreign Domestic Worker/Confinement Nanny who is due to enter Singapore. However, I need help to submit an entry application or to fulfil the entry approval responsibilities (e.g. arranging for my FDW or nanny’s SHN accommodation and her pre-departure COVID-19 test) What should I do?

You may wish to engage an employment agency to submit an application on your behalf. In this case, the employment agency will need to fulfil the entry approval responsibilities.

#### 7. I cannot submit an entry application as my employee does not have a Singapore-registered mobile phone number. As I urgently require manpower, can I submit my own mobile phone number instead?

No, employers/applicants are required to submit the Singapore-registered mobile phone number used by an arriving employee. The contact number provided in the entry approval application would be used by the relevant authorities to conduct Stay-Home Notice (SHN) compliance checks. 

If an employee does not have a Singapore-registered mobile number, employers may enquire with the relevant telcos on the purchase of prepaid SIM cards. When the employee arrives in Singapore, please arrange for the SIM card to be delivered to him/her.

### MOM-issued Passes: Applications, Extensions and Levies

#### 1. The Visit Pass issued to my Confinement Nanny is expiring before the end of her work assignment. Do I need to extend her Visit Pass?

You need to request for an extension of her stay if:
- The duration of her visit pass does not cover her employment period. If she is transferring to another employer in Singapore, you can make the request for her, or she can engage an employment agency to do so. 
- She leaves Singapore during the employment period. Her visit pass will be cancelled when she leaves, and you have to request for an extension each time she leaves and returns to Singapore.

Please [submit the extension request](https://form.gov.sg/5d01bad00816b400111ce556) at least 2 weeks before her visit pass expires and upload these documents:
-  Front and back of her Disembarkation/Embarkation (D/E) card (maximum 1MB) 
- Personal particulars page of her passport (maximum 1MB)

We will email you the outcome within 2 weeks. A $40 extension fee will be charged for each extension made beyond 3 months from the date the visit pass was issued. 

#### 3. My employee’s work pass is expiring. He/She is unable to return to Singapore for the pass renewal due to the travel restrictions imposed in their home country or are unable to obtain an entry approval. What should I do? 

We advise employers to submit a new work pass application for such employees after the situation stabilises. 

#### 4. Can employers get a levy waiver for their Foreign Domestic Worker, Work Permit or S Pass holder who are required to serve SHN upon their arrival to Singapore? 

MOM will waive foreign worker levies for all Foreign Domestic Workers, Work Permit and S Pass holders and Work Permit holders for the duration of their SHN from January till September 2021. This is to help employers manage the increased costs associated with the Government’s updated measures to reduce the risk of importing COVID-19 into the community. Please refer to MOM’s [press release](https://mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/0401-waiver-of-fwl-for-migrant-workers-and-migrant-domestic-workers-during-their-shn) for more information. 
 
#### 5. Can employers get a levy waiver for Work Permit, S Pass holders or Foreign Domestic Workers who have returned home or gone on overseas leave?

For employees on home or overseas leave, employers can [apply for levy waiver](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Employer/MyRequestEmployer) (for up to 60 days) **when the employees return to Singapore**.

#### 6. Must I still pay my FDW salary while she is serving her Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

For new FDWs, you must start paying her salary once she is deployed to your house after her SHN.

For existing FDWs returning from overseas, you must continue paying her salary once she returns to Singapore.

<div id="covidtest"></div>

#### 1. My employee has recently recovered from COVID-19. Are they still required to be tested for COVID-19 before entry into Singapore?

Please refer to the FAQ for recovered travellers [here](/health/faq#pcrtestQ5).

#### 2. My employee is required to take a COVID-19 test in Singapore as part of the entry requirements. How do I arrange for the test and do I need to pay?

You would be required to pay for the COVID-19 test and other entry approval charges during the entry application. Employers do not need to arrange for the COVID-19 test administered during their SHN for their employees. These appointments are scheduled automatically, and pass holders would receive the appointment details as an SMS. 

For the on-arrival COVID-19 test, employers will need to book and pay for them. 

#### 3. Is my employee required to take a Serology test in Singapore? How so I arrange for the test and am I also required to pay for this?

Presently, only the following categories of workers are required to take a Serology test in Singapore:
- Confinement nannies arriving in Singapore from high-risk countries/regions
- Foreign Domestic Workers arriving in Singapore from high-risk countries/regions
- Work Permit and S Pass holders from the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sectors who are arriving in Singapore from high-risk countries/regions

Employers do not need to arrange for the serology test appointment as this would be scheduled automatically by the relevant Government agency. There is no need for the employee to pay for the serology test upon arrival as the cost of the test would have been included when payment was made by their employer during entry application. Employers can check the details of the Serology test for their employee through: 
- [Safe@Work Portal](https://mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/safe-work) for Work Permit and S Pass holders from the CMP sectors
- [Email MOM](mailto:ace_mom@mom.gov.sg) for Confinement nannies and Foreign Domestic Workers 

#### 4. My employee claims to be unwell while serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN). What should I do?

Travellers who are [ill or unwell](/health/covid19-symptoms) while serving their SHN should alert MOM using the [FWMOMCare app](https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/fwmomcare) and remain in their accommodation. In the event of a medical emergency, please advise your employee to alert the SHN-Dedicated Facility (SDF) operator and call 995 for assistance.

##### For information on the Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) requirement imposed on workers that are in Singapore, click [here](https://mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/rostered-routine-testing).

<div id="shn"></div>

### Stay-Home Notice (SHN) and SHN-Dedicated Facilities

#### 1. Can my employee leave their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) accommodation for any pass issuance-related procedures, e.g. medical examination, finger printing, Settling-in Programmes or safety courses?

As a condition for entry under the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL), travellers who have been served an [SHN](/health/shn) upon arrival in Singapore must complete their SHN before proceeding with their regular activities. This means that your employee must not do any of the pass issuance-related procedures until they have completed their SHN and tested negative for COVID-19.

Travellers and employers should note that non-compliance with the SHN conditions is an offence that could attract a fine and/or imprisonment term. MOM may also initiate pass revocation procedures or withdraw the relevant work pass privileges. 

In general, individual served with an SHN are not permitted to leave their SHN accommodation, including the [SHN Dedicated Facility (SDF)](/health/shn/sdf), during the stipulated SHN period. Travellers are only permitted to leave their SHN accommodation or SDF for their [COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction test (“PCR test”)](/health/covid19-tests/pcrtest) or Serology test. Transport to and from the designated testing facility would be arranged as travellers are prohibited from commuting using public transport.

#### 2. Is my Foreign Domestic Worker/Confinement Nanny allowed to share rooms at the Stay-Home Notice Dedicated Facility (SDF)? Where can I submit the room sharing application?

Employers may request for a shared room on behalf of their employees when applying for an Entry Approval. However, employers should advise their employees on the health risks involved in a room sharing arrangement, which could result in increased risk of infection and attract additional charges, e.g. medical treatment.

Should your employee acknowledge the health risks but continue to express interest on sharing rooms, employers should provide their employees with an indemnity form for completion and signing. These forms are available below, and employers are encouraged to provide their employees with a form in a language familiar to them.
- Bahasa Indonesia
- Bengali
- Burmese
- Chinese
- English
- Hindi
- Sinhalese
- Tagalog
- Tamil

Employers should remind their employees to present the following documents to the SDF operator during check-in, who will then facilitate the room sharing arrangement:
- Entry Approval Letter
- Completed and signed indemnity form (your employee may ask for a blank indemnity form from the SDF if they forget to print a copy).

### Payment, Cost-sharing Matters and Refunds

#### 1. My Confinement Nanny/Foreign Domestic Worker had contracted COVID-19 from her roommate while serving her Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon arrival in Singapore. Who is responsible for the cost of her medical treatment?

<div id="vaccinated"></div>

### COVID-19 Vaccination Requirements for Work Pass Holders and Dependants

#### 1. My helper/confinement nanny is fully vaccinated. Why can’t I submit an entry application to bring her into Singapore?

Due to the need to reschedule helpers and confinement nannies from higher-risk countries/regions, new entry applications can only be accepted for helpers and confinement nannies who remained in the following lower-risk countries/regions for 21 consecutive days before arrival:
- Brunei
- Hong Kong
- Macao
- Mainland China
- New Zealand
- Taiwan 

We understand these measures are difficult for employers and seek understanding on the need for control measures to keep Singapore safe. We are working towards allowing new applications at a later date.

#### 2. My pass holder is fully vaccinated, but not with a vaccine on the PSAR or WHO EUL list. Can I submit an entry application for him/her?

Pass holders who are vaccinated with the full regimen of [PSAR-approved](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) or [WHO EUL vaccines](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) (refer to **“COVID-19 Vaccine EUL issued”** section) will be prioritised for entry. 

Pass holders who took other types of vaccines will not meet the entry requirements. Thus, please **do not** submit entry applications for them.

#### 3. My pass holder is unvaccinated but has recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection. Does he/she still need to be fully vaccinated before arriving in Singapore?

Yes, all pass holders with travel history within the last 21 days before arrival to higher-risk countries/regions (i.e. all countries/regions, except Brunei, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand and Taiwan) must be [fully vaccinated](/wphl/vaccination-requirements) before arrival. 

#### 4. My pass holder is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and tested negative for COVID-19 in the pre-departure PCR test. Can he/she be exempted from Stay-Home Notice (SHN)?

Fully vaccinated pass holders are still subject to the [prevailing travel health control measures](/wphl/shn-and-swab-summary), which include serving SHN depending on their travel histories. 

#### 5. My pass holder has a doctor’s memo stating he/she cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions. Can he/she show this memo at the checkpoint, without having to request for an exemption?

No, pass holders need to obtain an approval from Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to be exempted. Companies must submit an [exemption request for their pass holders](https://www.mom.gov.sg/exempt-vaccination) and upload the doctor’s memo. If the request is approved, your company can then proceed with the [pass holder’s entry application](https://go.gov.sg/wphl-requirements).

#### 6. My pass holder does not wish to send his/her child (aged 12 years old to below 18 years old) for the COVID-19 vaccination in Singapore. Can the child be exempted?

Unvaccinated children who are 12 years old to below 18 years old on date of entry must get their first vaccination in Singapore using a [Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR)-approved vaccine](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) within 1 month of arrival. They must complete the full vaccination regime within 2 months of arrival.

However, if the child cannot be vaccinated due to medical conditions, please get a doctor’s memo which must meet all these requirements:
- States child’s medication condition 
- States reason why the child cannot take any COVID-19 vaccinations, regardless of the brand of vaccine 
- Is clear and not handwritten
- (Only applicable if memo is not in English) Is accompanied with an English-translated copy from a translation service provider

Please produce the memo when requested by the authorities. 

#### 7. My pass holder was vaccinated 2 days ago. Can he/she enter Singapore next week?

No, the pass holder cannot enter Singapore yet. 

Pass holders must receive the full regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty, Moderna or [WHO EUL vaccines](https://extranet.who.int/pqweb/vaccines/covid-19-vaccines) (refer to **“COVID-19 Vaccine EUL issued”** section) **at least 14 days before arriving in Singapore**. 

Example: If the pass holder received the full vaccine regimen on 1 Sep, the earliest he/she can enter Singapore is **15 Sep**.

#### 8. My pass holder is fully vaccinated and took a serology test with Ministry of Health’s designated healthcare provider. However, the serology test result was negative or inconclusive. What happens next?

The pass holder will have to complete the full vaccination regime using a [PSAR-approved vaccine](https://www.hsa.gov.sg/hsa-psar) within 3 months of arrival in Singapore. Failure to do so may result in the suspension and revocation of the pass holder’s work pass privileges.

#### 9. My pass holder has an approval to enter Singapore. However, Ministry of Manpower (MOM) informed me that his/her entry will have to be delayed. I understand MOM will email me when to bring him/her in. Does he/she need to be fully vaccinated before arrival?

No, the pass holder does not need to be vaccinated before arrival. The vaccination requirement only applies to pass holders who obtained entry approvals **from 10 Aug 2021**.

MOM will email you to exempt your pass holder from the vaccination requirement.
