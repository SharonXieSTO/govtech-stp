### General Queries

#### 1. I had applied for an Entry Approval under the Work Pass Holder General Lane but was not informed of the application outcome. What should I do?

Applicants should note that all applications will only be processed after payment is made. Depending on your email settings, the approval letter may be found in your spam or junk folder. Should you have difficulties locating the approval letter please write in with details of your application (e.g. application reference number, FIN and FIN expiry of your employee) to the following channels: 
- If you applied via the SafeTravel Portal, write in using the SafeTravel enquiries form ([here](https://go.gov.sg/sto-enquiry)) for assistance.
- If you applied directly with MOM, please write to MOM [here](https://service2.mom.gov.sg/efeedback/Forms/efeedback.aspx) for assistance.

#### 2. My employee plans to leave Singapore for a short personal trip. How should I advise them?

Employers may highlight to their employees that the travel restrictions implemented worldwide to curb the spread of [COVID-19](/health/covid19-symptoms) could affect flight availability and their ability to return to Singapore for work promptly. They will also be subject to the prevailing health measures on return. Additionally, the Singapore Government no longer covers the relevant medical costs for all new and existing pass holders who develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival in Singapore (press release [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers).

#### 3. My employee has been approved for entry into Singapore under the Work Pass Holder General Lane (WPHL) .However, he/she is unable to enter Singapore on the date specified in the application, or I no longer wish to bring them in. What should I do? 

To bring your employee into Singapore on another date, please submit a new entry application for him/her to enter Singapore on another date. 

For us to consider a refund of the entry approval charges for the previous application, please submit a request to cancel the entry approval:
