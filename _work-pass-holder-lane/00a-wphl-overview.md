### Overview and Application

All pass holders (work pass holders and dependents) must obtain entry approvals from the relevant government agencies to enter Singapore.

However, those conveying essential services or supplies (E.g. lorry drivers or vegetable supply truckers) coming from Malaysia by land or sea crossing are exempted from the entry approval requirement.

For: 
- **Existing work pass holders who are Malaysians or Malaysia permanent residents and entering Singapore by land**, employers can sponsor their entry under the [Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA)](/pca/overview).
- **All other pass holders, including those on In-Principle Approval, Dependant's Pass, MOM-issued Long Term Visit Pass and Letter of Consent**, must continue to obtain <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore" target="_blank"> MOM's entry approval</a> to enter Singapore, except for those who have an approval under the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL).
