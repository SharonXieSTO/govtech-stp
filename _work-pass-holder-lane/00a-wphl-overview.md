### Overview and Application

All pass holders (work pass holders and dependents) must obtain entry approvals from the relevant government agencies to enter Singapore. Singapore Work Pass Holders and their dependants must obtain [MOM’s entry approval](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore) to enter Singapore.

However, those conveying essential services or supplies (E.g. lorry drivers or vegetable supply truckers) coming from Malaysia by land or sea crossing are exempted from the entry approval requirement.

For: 
- **Existing work pass holders who are Malaysians or Malaysia permanent residents and entering Singapore by land**, employers can sponsor their entry under the [Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA)](/pca/overview).
- **All other pass holders, including those on In-Principle Approval, Dependant's Pass, MOM-issued Long Term Visit Pass and Letter of Consent**, must continue to obtain <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-to-bring-pass-holders-into-singapore" target="_blank"> MOM's entry approval</a> to enter Singapore, except for those who have an approval under the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL).

Pass holders travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore may take either:
<ol style="font-size:18px; list-style-type:upper-alpha;"> 
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">a flight designated by the Singapore Government and Hong Kong Government under the ATB; or
</li>
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">a non-designated flight.</li>
  </ol>

They must meet the requirements for the type of flight that they are taking.

#### (A) Designated ATB Flights

For those travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore on a flight designated by the Singapore Government and Hong Kong Government under the ATB, they will be allowed to go about their activities upon entry into Singapore, without a need to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

To be eligible to take a designated ATB flight, they are required to:
<ol style="font-size:18px; list-style-type:disc;"> 
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">remain in Hong Kong and/or Singapore in the last 14 consecutive days before departure from Hong Kong; and </li>
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">undergo a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore at one of the <a href="https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/pdf/List_of_recognised_laboratories.pdf">testing institutions</a> recognised by the Hong Kong Government, obtain a test result certificate in English stating the following:
  <ol style="font-size:18px; list-style-type:lower-roman;"> 
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">Traveller’s name, date of birth, and passport number (as indicated in his/her passport);</li>
    <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">A negative COVID-19 PCR test result;</li>
    <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">Date and time when the COVID-19 PCR test was taken; and</li>
    <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">Name of the testing institution where the test was taken.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>

Pass holders are responsible for making their own appointments with the testing institutions in Hong Kong to take their pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test. They must also bear the cost of their test. Please check with the listed testing institutions for the cost of the test.

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year are not required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore.

The designated ATB flights from Hong Kong to Singapore are:

**On 22 November 2020 (inaugural flight)**
<ol style="font-size:18px; list-style-type:disc;"> 
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.5;">CX759 (HKG–SIN) operated by Cathay Pacific Airways</li>
  </ol>

**From 23 November 2020 to 31 December 2020**
<ol style="font-size:18px; list-style-type:disc;"> 
  <li style="font-size:18px; line-height:1.0;">CX759 (HKG–SIN) operated by Cathay Pacific Airways</li>
    <li style="font-size:18px; margin-top:-10px; line-height:0.8;">SQ891 (HKG-SIN) operated by Singapore Airlines</li>
  </ol>

For information on the designated ATB flights from 1 January 2021 onwards, please refer to the websites of Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines.

Pass holders arriving on designated ATB flights will be required to take an on-arrival COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at Changi Airport. This will take effect on 22 November 2020. The additional requirement is a precautionary measure given the rise of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong over the past few days.

After taking the test, pass holders are required to take private transportation, taxi, or private hire car from the airport to their own accommodation. They must remain isolated at their accommodation until their test result is confirmed to be negative. After being notified of their negative test results, they will be allowed to go about their activities in Singapore.

To provide time to adjust to this new requirement, pass holders will not need to pay for the on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test if they are entering Singapore <b>from 22 November 2020 to 28 November 2020</b>.

Children aged 12 or younger in that calendar year are not required to:
- undergo a COVID-19 PCR test within 72 hours before the scheduled departure time of the designated ATB flight from Hong Kong to Singapore; and
- undergo a COVID-19 PCR test at the airport upon arrival in Singapore


#### (B) Non-Designated Flights

For those travelling from Hong Kong to Singapore on a non-designated flight, they will be required to serve a 7-day SHN at their own accommodation upon entry into Singapore and undergo a COVID-19 PCR test during the SHN period.  Please click [here](/health) for more information on the prevailing SHN and COVID-19 test requirements upon entry into Singapore.

There is no need to undergo a pre-departure COVID-19 PCR test in Hong Kong for those travelling on non-designated flights.
