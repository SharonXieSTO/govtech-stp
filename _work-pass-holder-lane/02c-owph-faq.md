## FAQ for All Other Work Pass Holders employed by companies and their dependants

<div id="#1"></div>
### 1. My pass holders have recovered from COVID-19, when can I bring them into Singapore?

For pass holders who have recovered from COVID-19, they should only depart for Singapore <b>at least 21 days after</b> their first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Otherwise, they will be denied boarding on flights to Singapore.

If the pass holder’s first positive COVID-19 PCR test was taken on 1 March 2021, he/she can only depart for Singapore from 22 March 2021.

Pass holders should not travel if feeling unwell.

### 4. Can MOM extend or renew work passes nearing expiry if the foreign employees cannot return to Singapore because of the travel restrictions?

We advise employers to submit a new work pass application for such workers after the situation stabilises.

### 5. Can employers get a levy waiver if their Work Permit or S Pass holder is quarantined?

Employers can get a levy waiver for Work Permit or S Pass holders who are given quarantine orders by MOH, as it is a form of hospitalisation leave.

<a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Employer/MyRequestEmployer">Apply for levy waiver</a>

### 6. Can employers get a levy waiver for Work Permit or S Pass holders who went on home / overseas leave?

For employees on home or overseas leave, employers can <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Employer/MyRequestEmployer">apply for levy waiver</a> (for up to 60 days) <b>when the employees return to Singapore</b>.

### 7. Can employers send their pass holders for any issuance-related procedures (e.g. medical examination, finger-printing, Settling-In-Programme or safety courses) during the SHN?

No, pass holders must complete their SHN before their employers can send them for any of the above-mentioned issuance-related procedures. If their Short-Term Visit Passes (STVP) are expiring soon, for:

<ul>
<li>Employment Pass, S Pass, Dependant’s Pass or Long Term Visit Pass holders, please <b><a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/extend-stay">request for time to do the issuance</a></b> while the pass holders serve SHN. Submit your request <b>within 1 week</b> before the STVP expires.</li> 
<li>Work Permit holders, the validities of their STVPs and in-principle approvals will be automatically extended by 2 weeks. Please note that no letters will be issued for this extension.</li>
</ul>

MOM will not hesitate to take enforcement measures against any parties who do not comply with the SHN requirements. Measures include criminal proceedings, work pass revocations and withdrawal of work pass privileges.

### 8. My pass holders intend to travel out of Singapore. What risks should I consider and how should I advise them?

Please discourage your pass holder from going overseas as the country he/she is visiting may have travel restrictions. Thus, there could be significant delays before he/she can return to Singapore.

For all pass holders, new and existing, entering Singapore <b>from 1 January 2021</b>, <b><a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-to-stay-home-notice-and-charging-policy-for-travellers">the Government will no longer cover their treatment costs</a></b> if they develop COVID-19 symptoms or test positive within 14 days of arrival in Singapore. This is regardless of when they left Singapore.
